<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Hello! It's been an eventful few <del>weeks</del> months: <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-switch-up-v2/5737999606218752">the job</a> has been quit, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/so-anyone-want-to-buy-a-truck/5743537530339328">the truck</a> has been sold, the California has been left, and the new venture has been started (full-time!).

<p>Selling the truck is probably the biggest and most blog-relevant event. Even though I'd already announced my <em>plans</em> to sell it, having legitimately sold it still feels <em>different</em>. One of those things that doesn't really register until it's actually happened. Truly the end of an era. In Marie Kondo-fashion, I thank the truck for its service and wish it the best in its new life.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, as best as I can tell, it won't be used as the stealth<sup><em>ish</em></sup> RV I've used it as. Rather, it'll be used to help a couple start their fledgling potato chip business, which is delightfully specific and quirky. Not that the truck cares either way, but I'm glad it'll be put to (good?) use.</p>
<p>Since none of my stuff is relevant to hauling potato chips around, I took it all out of the truck and loaded it into <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-2-of-3-a-car/5630110493310976">my beloved 2004 Honda Civic</a>, now my only motor vehicle.</p>

<p>The new truck owners told me I didn't have to rip out the insulation, which I appreciated. Eagle-eyed blog readers might notice that <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-1-of-3-a-bike-/5761673931522048">my bike</a> looks a bit different than usual, which I have every intention of eventually writing about.</p>
</div>
<p>But this post isn't about the minutiae of my move, it's about <em>why</em> any of this is happening at all. Why I'm shaking up my life in such dramatic fashion. But before we get to that, it's probably useful to rewind a bit and go on a tangent or two, which is really standard fare at this point.</p>
<h2>A Game of Roles</h2>
<p>I'm a big believer in actively <em>choosing</em> the life you want to live, mainly because if you don't, more clever and enterprising folk will pick your life for you, usually to their benefit. Part of choosing your life is asking lots of questions about how you spend your time, why you spend your time that way, and if you like spending your time that way.</p>
<p>Of course, this only makes sense once you've got the more visceral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">basic layers of Maslow's hierarchy</a> covered. It's kinda hard to think about what you want out of life if you don't know where your next meal is coming from. Which is to say that I recognize there's a certain amount of privilege embedded in <em>even being able</em> to think about the things I'm rambling about. That ackowledged, let's talk about time.</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>Time. We inhabit our respective mortal coils for a short and finite amount of it. It flies by. We never have enough of it. And so on and so forth. Since it's so scarce and precious, it seems reasonable to scrutinize those things that consume the most of it. And for the majority of folks between the ages of 18 and 65 (or thereabouts), the most time-consuming activity is exchanging it for money (aka "a job"). And so it follows that it's useful to ask what role you want that job to play in your life.</p>
<p>Personally, I've always oscillated on what I think the role of work should be in my life, and it looks something like this:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9SVEcvNsxGFZarWpTKRv2buubmnExL_RyDGdd0uf8e-uquRdoP1I8qIK0euf54jCb1nMQTclNlm9TtD3ajNMsr2Rq0AB9FNlPCRExcNGOvqRUSn_=s600"/>
<p>Yes, this is my actual handwriting. Yes, it is bad.<br/>No, the y-axis doesn't make a lot of sense, it should probably be labeled "white savior complex" or "inverse cynicism" or something.</p>
</div>
<p>Basically, I bounce back and forth between two modes of operation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>"Work can be a force for removing misery from the world"</strong> - In this mode, I try to convince myself that the work I'm doing is not only keeping me fed, but also improves the lives of other folks in some way. I get to feel warm and fuzzy about what I spend most of my time doing, my employer implicitly gets a discount on my labor.</li>
<li><strong>"Work is a transaction, plain and simple"</strong> - In this mode, I am a machine that consumes coffee and kale, and produces code, efficiently run meetings, and&#8230;well, poop. I sell my labor to the highest (non-arms-dealing) bidder. "Doing good" at a company is just a marketing ploy to attract young, fresh talent, who haven't had enough time to become jaded by the actual shape of the world yet.</li>
</ol>
<h3>"Serving the Public Conversation"</h3>
<p>That first way of thinking (i.e. Doing Good Things at Work&#8482;) is leveraged to nauseating effect by Bay Area employers. You'd legitimately be hard-pressed to find a Silicon Valley tech job listing that doesn't frame itself in terms of the "impact" or societal good that you'll do working there. To give an illustrative example, I picked Twitter, pretty much at random, but you'll have similar success by throwing darts at any ol' tech stock index fund. </p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/r5KrkpJKJwIjVqowXIwEQ8U5dwKiw3ZX9NtCcP5NX5RJJsE69GvJ_etHuVDwp_mh0tTNQcV1OV7N97OPrbZv7C60UUq6HkTQasD9hQntfTn52OtB=s750"/>
<p>From <a href="https://about.twitter.com/en">Twitter's About page</a></p>
</div>
<p>There's a lot to unpack here, but I'm going to leave most of it in the box. The thing I want to note is that Twitter, which makes 89% of its revenue from selling ads, and the remaining 11% from selling data,<sup>1</sup> talks a big game about "[serving] the public conversation" in their hiring materials.</p>
<p>And sure, Twitter does indeed do that. But that isn't <em>why</em> Twitter exists. As with any for-profit corporation, they quite literally exists to generate value for their shareholders. Nothing more, nothing less.<sup>2</sup> But when you're vying for a limited pool of data scientists and machine learning experts, you'll probably be more successful in hiring by telling prospective employees that they're "[serving] the public conversation," even if the day-to-day job description is more like "[finding] new ways to hoover more data (and therefore shareholder value) from our users".</p>
<p>And so I oscillate between drinking the Kool-Aid and being disenchanted with the endless streams of disingenuous verbal diarrhea that companies spew in the name of attracting talent.<sup>3</sup> But I also can't blame them, because people <em>do</em> want to feel like they're doing something good or making a difference or whatever with their work. Of course, work can just be about work. But, given the choice between two otherwise identical jobs, I reckon most folks would take the one that purports to be about something <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the warm fuzzy feeling we get when we do something "good". Maybe it's because we want to sound interesting and altruistic at cocktail parties. Maybe it's part of a larger narrative we're trying to weave about the purpose of our respective lives. Maybe it's all the above. Maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about.</p>
<h2>Me, Personally</h2>
<p>Wading out of the depths of hand-wavy generalizations and talk of people in the abstract, what do <em>I</em> want out of work? I've got a roof over my head and food in the fridge, why <em>shouldn't</em> I make work about more than than just work? As a starting point, I looked at my life and some deeply held<sup>4</sup> beliefs:</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe that life is a cosmic poker game where way too many people get dealt a truly terrible hand through absolutely no fault of their own. <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/truck-tenets-at-the-core/5164606641143808">See previous ramblings.</a></li>
<li>I've been dealt a pretty stellar hand, both in relative and absolute terms. You know, the whole being-born-in-a-rich-country-and-not-into-abject-poverty thing.</li>
<li>I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOywn1qArI">a very particular set of skills</a>, which are in demand and applicable to a diverse set of problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do I pick a job based on these things? Historically, I've been pretty awful at it, falling prey to the aforementioned glossy marketing material/Kool-Aid. But it sounds like I want a job where I use my skills to attempt to level the cosmic playing field. And I don't want this "doing good" to be a side-effect of some other business/money-making venture, I want it to be the direct goal/outcome of my work.</p>
<p>And from there, it seems pretty clear I won't be looking at traditional for-profit organizations. I spent <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-switch-up/5670405876482048">a few years</a> working at a healthcare-focused tech company, where I worked on surgical robots, baby diaper sensors, temperature + COVID sensing patches, etc. All of those technologies have the potential to improve people's lives, which is cool. There are two main problems though:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those technologies are addressing problems and needs, but not the biggest or most urgent problems and needs.</li>
<li>The people who will have access to those technologies are not-so-coincidentally people who have significantly more wealth than the median human being on this planet.</li>
</ol>
<p>That second point is the source of most of my cynicism. If you are a for-profit organization, you have a fiduciary responsibility to make decisions that will generate returns for your shareholders. Those returns need to come from <em>somewhere</em>, meaning that some party in your business model is giving you money. This usually means you aren't building things directly for the global poor because, by definition, they have no money to give you.</p>
<p>There are, of course, exceptions to this. Governments and private foundations will sometimes foot the bill for things that benefit the poor, even if they come from for-profit corporations. Examples include the US government buying medicine for low-income Americans via Medicaid, and the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/our-work/places/east-asia/japan">Gates Foundation</a> funding private biotech companies doing medical research that can benefit low- and middle-income countries via <a href="https://www.ghitfund.org/">Global Health Innovative Technology Fund</a>. Beyond that, climate change-adjacent technologies, like carbon capture or better batteries, are promising in that they can be both wildly profitable and beneficial to the global poor,<sup>5</sup> who disproportionately have <strong>not</strong> produced the emissions warming the planet.</p>
<p>So if I <em>was</em> going to go into industry somewhere, it'd probably be in green/climate technology. But that's not what I've done. Instead, I've started a nonprofit. I'll start with the elevator pitch, then a pre-emptory straw man Q &amp; A.</p>
<h2>The Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p>First, an opinion: the two most important problems in the world are climate change and global inequality, for different but intertwined reasons. Further, I claim that nonprofit organizations have made great strides in both domains, whether by lobbying for greener public policy, or helping to eliminate smallpox or control malaria. Continuing the claim-train: nonprofits don't invest in technology the same way for-profit organizations do, usually because nonprofits have more limited resources, and using technology effectively requires some level of upfront investment (engineers and/or IT folk) that isn't feasible, especially when the nonprofit also has their actual mission to spend time and money on.<sup>6</sup> The result is that nonprofits don't get to reap the benefits of investing in technology to automate all of the manual minutiae they deal with day to day.</p>
<p>And that's the crux of the idea: use my existing skills to help nonprofits use technology better. I am not an climate change expert, nor do I have a strong background in dealing with global inequality. Even calling myself "moderately knowledgeable" is probably a stretch. But there are well-run, effective organizations chock full o' experts for each of those areas, and I can help <em>them</em> achieve their goals better through strategic application of tech (IT stuff, computers, cloud systems, custom software, etc).</p>
<p>I talked with a few nonprofits to see if any of this makes any sense whatsoever, and it seems like it does. Further, there are indeed organizations, both nonprofit and otherwise, that help nonprofits use technology, like <a href="https://softwareforgood.com/">Software for Good</a> and <a href="https://www.techsoup.org/about-us">Tech Soup</a>. This is all to say that this isn't a novel idea, but it's clearly one with some merit, and I think it's an under-served area.</p>
<h3>A Straw Man Q &amp; A</h3>
<p><strong><em>But Brandon, didn't you just leave your job?</em></strong></p>
<p>In my defense, it's been a <em>whole</em> year, which is an eon in the world of tech. That one year was enough time for me to build and deploy a whole platform for the startup I've mostly left (but still moonlight for). Not so coincidentally, it was the experience of building this platform that made me go, "You know, I'm at a point in my career where I can kinda just build arbitrary stuff on my own."</p>
<p><strong><em>You're starting a tech nonprofit? Could you be any more of a Silicon Valley clich&#233;?</em></strong></p>
<p>I'm sure if I <em>really</em> tried, I could figure something out.</p>
<p><strong><em>If there are organizations already doing this, why not join one of them?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, a few reasons. The first is that I want to focus on a narrow subset of nonprofits, ones that I think are working on The Most Important Problems&#8482;. Aside from that, I have some ideas on how to make the technology side of things 'scale' well,<sup>7</sup> ranging from how we build and deploy stuff, to how we structure legal contracts, etc, etc, and it'd be harder to try those things out if I wasn't calling the shots. Plus, I convinced a talented engineer and good friend from Google to join me in starting this endeavor, which certainly helps.</p>
<p>Beyond that, nonprofits don't really compete with each other in the same way that for-profit businesses do. They certainly compete for donor dollars, but more nonprofits working on big problems is generally a good thing and they can happily co-exist/specialize/whatever. As for the donor dollars, I expect that most of the funding for the organization will come from the (heavily discounted) software consulting services we provide and the occasional grant, not directly from donors.</p>
<p><strong><em>What's the name of your new organization?</em></strong></p>
<p>I'm going to strategically omit that one, as I have no desire to link my truck-related degeneracy with the organization I plan to spend years (at least!) working on and growing. That said, if you represent a private foundation or a nonprofit working on climate change or global inequality and would like more information, feel free to reach out to me through <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/about">my blog email</a>.</p>
<p><sup class="small">1</sup><em class="small">This is according to Twitter's <a href="https://investor.twitterinc.com/financial-information/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=15578431">10-K SEC filing</a>. Also I'm using numbered footnotes instead of my usual asterisks because I have seven of them, and ******* looks less like a footnote and more like I'm censoring myself.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">2</sup><em class="small">Now, before people start calling me a "communist", I'll note that I'm not making any political or economic arguments here, I'm just regurgitating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_corporation">the definition</a> of what it means to be a for-profit corporation. Then again, I wouldn't expect people who use "communist" as a derogatory term to have read all the way to the footnotes.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">3</sup><em class="small">This is perhaps the only area where I can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=2177s">appreciate Oracle</a>. Well, seems like their recruiting department didn't get the memo, because <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/careers/">their hiring page</a> is <strong>full</strong> of the same kind of non-specific "impact" garbage I've been complaining about.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">4</sup><em class="small">And backed up by data, when relevant.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">5</sup><em class="small">I mean, technically everyone benefits from the world not bursting into literal flames. It's just that 'everyone' happens to include 'the global poor'.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">6</sup><em class="small">Another reason is that donors frequently want their money to go to directly the cause, and things like "hiring someone to set up a sync between Salesforce and &lt;some other system&gt;" are far less glamorous than "give orphans homes", even if doing the former allows the organization to do more of the latter.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">7</sup><em class="small">'Scale' in this context just means the amount of work required per additional unit of impact. For example, something that requires twice as much work to support twice as many nonprofits doesn't scale as well as something that only requires marginally more work for each additional nonprofit.</em></p>

<p>There's a lot to unpack here, but I'm going to leave most of it in the box. The thing I want to note is that Twitter, which makes 89% of its revenue from selling ads, and the remaining 11% from selling data,<sup>1</sup> talks a big game about "[serving] the public conversation" in their hiring materials.</p>
<p>And sure, Twitter does indeed do that. But that isn't <em>why</em> Twitter exists. As with any for-profit corporation, they quite literally exists to generate value for their shareholders. Nothing more, nothing less.<sup>2</sup> But when you're vying for a limited pool of data scientists and machine learning experts, you'll probably be more successful in hiring by telling prospective employees that they're "[serving] the public conversation," even if the day-to-day job description is more like "[finding] new ways to hoover more data (and therefore shareholder value) from our users".</p>
<p>And so I oscillate between drinking the Kool-Aid and being disenchanted with the endless streams of disingenuous verbal diarrhea that companies spew in the name of attracting talent.<sup>3</sup> But I also can't blame them, because people <em>do</em> want to feel like they're doing something good or making a difference or whatever with their work. Of course, work can just be about work. But, given the choice between two otherwise identical jobs, I reckon most folks would take the one that purports to be about something <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the warm fuzzy feeling we get when we do something "good". Maybe it's because we want to sound interesting and altruistic at cocktail parties. Maybe it's part of a larger narrative we're trying to weave about the purpose of our respective lives. Maybe it's all the above. Maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about.</p>
<h2>Me, Personally</h2>
<p>Wading out of the depths of hand-wavy generalizations and talk of people in the abstract, what do <em>I</em> want out of work? I've got a roof over my head and food in the fridge, why <em>shouldn't</em> I make work about more than than just work? As a starting point, I looked at my life and some deeply held<sup>4</sup> beliefs:</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe that life is a cosmic poker game where way too many people get dealt a truly terrible hand through absolutely no fault of their own. <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/truck-tenets-at-the-core/5164606641143808">See previous ramblings.</a></li>
<li>I've been dealt a pretty stellar hand, both in relative and absolute terms. You know, the whole being-born-in-a-rich-country-and-not-into-abject-poverty thing.</li>
<li>I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOywn1qArI">a very particular set of skills</a>, which are in demand and applicable to a diverse set of problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do I pick a job based on these things? Historically, I've been pretty awful at it, falling prey to the aforementioned glossy marketing material/Kool-Aid. But it sounds like I want a job where I use my skills to attempt to level the cosmic playing field. And I don't want this "doing good" to be a side-effect of some other business/money-making venture, I want it to be the direct goal/outcome of my work.</p>
<p>And from there, it seems pretty clear I won't be looking at traditional for-profit organizations. I spent <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-switch-up/5670405876482048">a few years</a> working at a healthcare-focused tech company, where I worked on surgical robots, baby diaper sensors, temperature + COVID sensing patches, etc. All of those technologies have the potential to improve people's lives, which is cool. There are two main problems though:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those technologies are addressing problems and needs, but not the biggest or most urgent problems and needs.</li>
<li>The people who will have access to those technologies are not-so-coincidentally people who have significantly more wealth than the median human being on this planet.</li>
</ol>
<p>That second point is the source of most of my cynicism. If you are a for-profit organization, you have a fiduciary responsibility to make decisions that will generate returns for your shareholders. Those returns need to come from <em>somewhere</em>, meaning that some party in your business model is giving you money. This usually means you aren't building things directly for the global poor because, by definition, they have no money to give you.</p>
<p>There are, of course, exceptions to this. Governments and private foundations will sometimes foot the bill for things that benefit the poor, even if they come from for-profit corporations. Examples include the US government buying medicine for low-income Americans via Medicaid, and the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/our-work/places/east-asia/japan">Gates Foundation</a> funding private biotech companies doing medical research that can benefit low- and middle-income countries via <a href="https://www.ghitfund.org/">Global Health Innovative Technology Fund</a>. Beyond that, climate change-adjacent technologies, like carbon capture or better batteries, are promising in that they can be both wildly profitable and beneficial to the global poor,<sup>5</sup> who disproportionately have <strong>not</strong> produced the emissions warming the planet.</p>
<p>So if I <em>was</em> going to go into industry somewhere, it'd probably be in green/climate technology. But that's not what I've done. Instead, I've started a nonprofit. I'll start with the elevator pitch, then a pre-emptory straw man Q &amp; A.</p>
<h2>The Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p>First, an opinion: the two most important problems in the world are climate change and global inequality, for different but intertwined reasons. Further, I claim that nonprofit organizations have made great strides in both domains, whether by lobbying for greener public policy, or helping to eliminate smallpox or control malaria. Continuing the claim-train: nonprofits don't invest in technology the same way for-profit organizations do, usually because nonprofits have more limited resources, and using technology effectively requires some level of upfront investment (engineers and/or IT folk) that isn't feasible, especially when the nonprofit also has their actual mission to spend time and money on.<sup>6</sup> The result is that nonprofits don't get to reap the benefits of investing in technology to automate all of the manual minutiae they deal with day to day.</p>
<p>And that's the crux of the idea: use my existing skills to help nonprofits use technology better. I am not an climate change expert, nor do I have a strong background in dealing with global inequality. Even calling myself "moderately knowledgeable" is probably a stretch. But there are well-run, effective organizations chock full o' experts for each of those areas, and I can help <em>them</em> achieve their goals better through strategic application of tech (IT stuff, computers, cloud systems, custom software, etc).</p>
<p>I talked with a few nonprofits to see if any of this makes any sense whatsoever, and it seems like it does. Further, there are indeed organizations, both nonprofit and otherwise, that help nonprofits use technology, like <a href="https://softwareforgood.com/">Software for Good</a> and <a href="https://www.techsoup.org/about-us">Tech Soup</a>. This is all to say that this isn't a novel idea, but it's clearly one with some merit, and I think it's an under-served area.</p>
<h3>A Straw Man Q &amp; A</h3>
<p><strong><em>But Brandon, didn't you just leave your job?</em></strong></p>
<p>In my defense, it's been a <em>whole</em> year, which is an eon in the world of tech. That one year was enough time for me to build and deploy a whole platform for the startup I've mostly left (but still moonlight for). Not so coincidentally, it was the experience of building this platform that made me go, "You know, I'm at a point in my career where I can kinda just build arbitrary stuff on my own."</p>
<p><strong><em>You're starting a tech nonprofit? Could you be any more of a Silicon Valley clich&#233;?</em></strong></p>
<p>I'm sure if I <em>really</em> tried, I could figure something out.</p>
<p><strong><em>If there are organizations already doing this, why not join one of them?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, a few reasons. The first is that I want to focus on a narrow subset of nonprofits, ones that I think are working on The Most Important Problems&#8482;. Aside from that, I have some ideas on how to make the technology side of things 'scale' well,<sup>7</sup> ranging from how we build and deploy stuff, to how we structure legal contracts, etc, etc, and it'd be harder to try those things out if I wasn't calling the shots. Plus, I convinced a talented engineer and good friend from Google to join me in starting this endeavor, which certainly helps.</p>
<p>Beyond that, nonprofits don't really compete with each other in the same way that for-profit businesses do. They certainly compete for donor dollars, but more nonprofits working on big problems is generally a good thing and they can happily co-exist/specialize/whatever. As for the donor dollars, I expect that most of the funding for the organization will come from the (heavily discounted) software consulting services we provide and the occasional grant, not directly from donors.</p>
<p><strong><em>What's the name of your new organization?</em></strong></p>
<p>I'm going to strategically omit that one, as I have no desire to link my truck-related degeneracy with the organization I plan to spend years (at least!) working on and growing. That said, if you represent a private foundation or a nonprofit working on climate change or global inequality and would like more information, feel free to reach out to me through <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/about">my blog email</a>.</p>
<p><sup class="small">1</sup><em class="small">This is according to Twitter's <a href="https://investor.twitterinc.com/financial-information/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=15578431">10-K SEC filing</a>. Also I'm using numbered footnotes instead of my usual asterisks because I have seven of them, and ******* looks less like a footnote and more like I'm censoring myself.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">2</sup><em class="small">Now, before people start calling me a "communist", I'll note that I'm not making any political or economic arguments here, I'm just regurgitating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_corporation">the definition</a> of what it means to be a for-profit corporation. Then again, I wouldn't expect people who use "communist" as a derogatory term to have read all the way to the footnotes.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">3</sup><em class="small">This is perhaps the only area where I can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=2177s">appreciate Oracle</a>. Well, seems like their recruiting department didn't get the memo, because <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/careers/">their hiring page</a> is <strong>full</strong> of the same kind of non-specific "impact" garbage I've been complaining about.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">4</sup><em class="small">And backed up by data, when relevant.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">5</sup><em class="small">I mean, technically everyone benefits from the world not bursting into literal flames. It's just that 'everyone' happens to include 'the global poor'.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">6</sup><em class="small">Another reason is that donors frequently want their money to go to directly the cause, and things like "hiring someone to set up a sync between Salesforce and &lt;some other system&gt;" are far less glamorous than "give orphans homes", even if doing the former allows the organization to do more of the latter.</em></p>
<p><sup class="small">7</sup><em class="small">'Scale' in this context just means the amount of work required per additional unit of impact. For example, something that requires twice as much work to support twice as many nonprofits doesn't scale as well as something that only requires marginally more work for each additional nonprofit.</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Hello! It's been an eventful few <del>weeks</del> months: <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-switch-up-v2/5737999606218752">the job</a> has been quit, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/so-anyone-want-to-buy-a-truck/5743537530339328">the truck</a> has been sold, the California has been left, and the new venture has been started (full-time!).

<p>Selling the truck is probably the biggest and most blog-relevant event. Even though I'd already announced my <em>plans</em> to sell it, having legitimately sold it still feels <em>different</em>. One of those things that doesn't really register until it's actually happened. Truly the end of an era. In Marie Kondo-fashion, I thank the truck for its service and wish it the best in its new life.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, as best as I can tell, it won't be used as the stealth<sup><em>ish</em></sup> RV I've used it as. Rather, it'll be used to help a couple start their fledgling potato chip business, which is delightfully specific and quirky. Not that the truck cares either way, but I'm glad it'll be put to (good?) use.</p>
<p>Since none of my stuff is relevant to hauling potato chips around, I took it all out of the truck and loaded it into <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-2-of-3-a-car/5630110493310976">my beloved 2004 Honda Civic</a>, now my only motor vehicle.</p>

<p>The new truck owners told me I didn't have to rip out the insulation, which I appreciated. Eagle-eyed blog readers might notice that <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-1-of-3-a-bike-/5761673931522048">my bike</a> looks a bit different than usual, which I have every intention of eventually writing about.</p>
</div>
<p>But this post isn't about the minutiae of my move, it's about <em>why</em> any of this is happening at all. Why I'm shaking up my life in such dramatic fashion. But before we get to that, it's probably useful to rewind a bit and go on a tangent or two, which is really standard fare at this point.</p>
<h2>A Game of Roles</h2>
<p>I'm a big believer in actively <em>choosing</em> the life you want to live, mainly because if you don't, more clever and enterprising folk will pick your life for you, usually to their benefit. Part of choosing your life is asking lots of questions about how you spend your time, why you spend your time that way, and if you like spending your time that way.</p>
<p>Of course, this only makes sense once you've got the more visceral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">basic layers of Maslow's hierarchy</a> covered. It's kinda hard to think about what you want out of life if you don't know where your next meal is coming from. Which is to say that I recognize there's a certain amount of privilege embedded in <em>even being able</em> to think about the things I'm rambling about. That ackowledged, let's talk about time.</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>Time. We inhabit our respective mortal coils for a short and finite amount of it. It flies by. We never have enough of it. And so on and so forth. Since it's so scarce and precious, it seems reasonable to scrutinize those things that consume the most of it. And for the majority of folks between the ages of 18 and 65 (or thereabouts), the most time-consuming activity is exchanging it for money (aka "a job"). And so it follows that it's useful to ask what role you want that job to play in your life.</p>
<p>Personally, I've always oscillated on what I think the role of work should be in my life, and it looks something like this:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9SVEcvNsxGFZarWpTKRv2buubmnExL_RyDGdd0uf8e-uquRdoP1I8qIK0euf54jCb1nMQTclNlm9TtD3ajNMsr2Rq0AB9FNlPCRExcNGOvqRUSn_=s600"/>
<p>Yes, this is my actual handwriting. Yes, it is bad.<br/>No, the y-axis doesn't make a lot of sense, it should probably be labeled "white savior complex" or "inverse cynicism" or something.</p>
</div>
<p>Basically, I bounce back and forth between two modes of operation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>"Work can be a force for removing misery from the world"</strong> - In this mode, I try to convince myself that the work I'm doing is not only keeping me fed, but also improves the lives of other folks in some way. I get to feel warm and fuzzy about what I spend most of my time doing, my employer implicitly gets a discount on my labor.</li>
<li><strong>"Work is a transaction, plain and simple"</strong> - In this mode, I am a machine that consumes coffee and kale, and produces code, efficiently run meetings, and&#8230;well, poop. I sell my labor to the highest (non-arms-dealing) bidder. "Doing good" at a company is just a marketing ploy to attract young, fresh talent, who haven't had enough time to become jaded by the actual shape of the world yet.</li>
</ol>
<h3>"Serving the Public Conversation"</h3>
<p>That first way of thinking (i.e. Doing Good Things at Work&#8482;) is leveraged to nauseating effect by Bay Area employers. You'd legitimately be hard-pressed to find a Silicon Valley tech job listing that doesn't frame itself in terms of the "impact" or societal good that you'll do working there. To give an illustrative example, I picked Twitter, pretty much at random, but you'll have similar success by throwing darts at any ol' tech stock index fund. </p>

That said, if you represent a private foundation or a nonprofit working on climate change or global inequality and would like more information, feel free to reach out to me through <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/about">my blog email</a>.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>A <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/end-of-an-era/5715332111007744">quick recap</a>: I'm quitting my job and moving out of the truck/state of California.</p>
<p>As a person who doesn't like having stuff they don't need/use, I'm getting rid of the truck. More specifically, as a person who recognizes the utility of money, I'm <strong>selling</strong> the truck.*</p>
<p>Using the blog in this fashion is probably the closest I'll ever get to monetizing it, but I think posting this here also makes sense for one other big reason:</p>
<p class="text-center">The truck is <em>weird</em>.</p>
<h2>Allow Me to Explain</h2>
<p>There are ostensibly two groups of people who might be interested in this truck:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>People who'd use it for moving things</strong> - As I'm more than <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/obvious-facts-about-box-trucks-2-theyre-great-for-moving-things/5691726094139392">happy to attest</a>, the truck is great for moving things. I've lost count, but I've used the truck to help people move on 15-20 occasions. But a truck for moving doesn't need a sunroof...or the interior door, and is that insulation on the walls??</li>
<li><strong>People who'd live in it</strong> - As I'm also more than happy to attest, one can totally live in this truck for long periods of time. That said, it's pretty bare bones. There's no power, plumbing, or any meaningful climate control, it only really makes sense if you're spending most of your waking hours elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Venn diagram of "people who'd be interested in the truck in its current state" contains more than just, well, me, it's likely one of you, dear blog reader(s).</p>
<p class="text-center">And so, here we are.</p>
<h2>Sweetening the Deal</h2>
<p>But selling things is generally such an uninspired affair, so I've got some ideas to keep it interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I'll deliver the truck to you, no extra charge</strong> - If you live in the contiguous 48 United States, I'll take a road trip to give you the truck. I get one last hurrah with my soon-to-be-former home, you get a box truck straight to your front door. The only catch is that, if anyone actually wants to take me up on this offer, they'll have to put down a deposit for half the truck up front.</li>
<li>
<strong>You can have my stuff, also no extra charge</strong> - The few things I currently own are pretty useful for truck living. In no particular order:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-8-starting-over/5720605454237696">Tool Cabinet</a> (strapped to the wall with earthquake straps)</li>
<li>Tools (saws, socket set, drill, etc)</li>
<li>Fireproof document safe</li>
<li>Lots of plastic tubs and trays for organization</li>
<li>Flashlight</li>
<li>Battery packs</li>
<li>Clothes hangers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, if someone wants <em>none</em> of those things, I'd just remove them all. I also have a bed and raised bed frame, if those are desirable. You can't have my clothes though, I think I'll still need those.**</p>
<h2>Product Description</h2>
<p>As for the truck itself, it's in pretty great shape. I've never had any mechanical problems, and I've gotten regular oil changes and replaced the tires and brakes. I also <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-ugly-truckling/5675267779461120">had the left headlight/fender and top radius/corner caps replaced</a> for aesthetics and stopping leaks, respectively. Attempting to be a good custodian of the truck, I have the paperwork for all of the above mentioned things.</p>
<p>I've only put two or three thousand miles on it over the past six years, mostly helping people move and driving it around to keep the battery charged and fluids moving around. I think it has 165,000 miles on it, but I can get the actual numbers for the actuarially inclined.</p>
<p>My asking price is $15,000, which I think is pretty reasonable, especially given that I've paid at least half of that in improvements alone. If you're interested, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/faq">leave a question</a> or email me at brandon AT frominsidethebox DOT com. I'm more than happy to answer any questions/send photos/etc.</p>
<p>If this fails and nobody here wants the truck, I'll probably just do A More Normal Thing&#8482; and put it on Craigslist or similar, so no pressure.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I've also tied up pretty much all my semi-liquid savings with this in-progress house purchase, so the cash infusion would certainly be useful.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">Well, at least the shirts, for video conferencing and whatnot.</em></p>

<em>Source: <span>It's...exactly what it looks like.</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I've always said that I'll keep living in the truck as long as it keeps making sense in the larger context of my life. And for the past ~6 years (plus or minus <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/pandemic-in-a-box/5718138591117312">a pandemic</a>), I think that's been the case. I'm young*, healthy, unencumbered by other humans depending on me for survival, and have had access to food, gyms, and other useful resources provided by employers. But now I've gone and quit my job to start my own <em>thing</em>, and suddenly the truck doesn't look quite so sensible any more.</p>
<p>On one hand, I certainly didn't plan on living in a truck for the rest of my life. On the other hand, I never knew <em><a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-question-of-time/5746311907246080">when</a></em> I would stop. Well, I think I've got that last part figured out now, and it turns out it's in like a week.</p>
<h2>The Next Chapter</h2>
<p>Originally, I was going to talk about my new work adventures here, but that ended up being long and only tangentially related, so I'll save that for another post. The long and short of it is that I've started an organization with a good friend/old co-worker of mine, we'll be running it as our full-time jobs, and I'm terribly excited about it. I'm in the process of purchasing** a modest place in a small, nature-y town in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest">PNW</a>, where I plan to live for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h2>Finding a Good Home</h2>
<p>Speaking of good homes, I'm also looking for one for my beloved box truck. If you're in the market for a vaguely habitable*** vehicle, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/about">hit me up</a>. I plan on giving it the full post it deserves within the next day or two,  just putting it out there now.</p>
<h2>Getting Somewhat Sentimental</h2>
<p>Few who know me would describe me as a sentimental person; I don't attach a ton of significance to things or places or dates or what-have-you. That said, I think it's second nature for people to organize their mental models of time into personal epochs, like being in college, working at a job, being in a romantic relationship, etc, etc, and I'm no different in that respect.</p>
<p>I definitely think of the truck as an era of my life, and an important one at that. Hell, I've lived in the truck longer than any other place since my childhood home, and I haven't lived there for like 17 years. I'm not the same person I was when I moved into the truck six and a half years ago, and I think the truck has played an outsized role in how I've changed since then.</p>
<p>Which is all to say that there's a certain bittersweetness to transitions like these. I'm excited for what the future may hold, but I also recognize that I'm giving up a big part of how I've lived for most of my adult life, and it'd be silly to not at least acknowledge that.</p>
<h2>And a Bit Existential</h2>
<p>As for the fate of this blog, I haven't really figured that one out yet. I enjoy putting stuff on here, though as anyone who's looked at the time gaps between the posts can attest, I take my sweet, sweet time in actually publishing things. I've also accumulated maybe two dozen half-finished posts over the years, so I should probably either finish those or toss them if they prove themselves completely irredeemable. We'll just have to see what happens!</p>
<p>Oh, and one last completely unrelated note &#8212; I was <em>totally</em> right about my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/and-suddenlysap/5635271169146880">sap situation</a>, because I found the truck looking like this after a particularly warm day.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ot5KNUhpffC48xfxQNgciV7Gv3p9uz2bcVe8JNhSMDih2GABsXVrdkUHt8bGYL4S1mBp6psA_q8RKQg6Jg6-EdBD9aOog-U-eJzFSaQjKSyCCX63sAE=s450"/>
<p>The sap from the roof melted and dripped down the side, because I was parked on an uneven road. As hideous as it looks, it's great validation for my "melting sap" theory.</p>
</div>
<p>*<em class="small">Though not so young as I was, mostly because of the linear nature of time and whatnot.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">For anyone keeping score, this will be my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-3-of-3-a-house/5696459148099584">third</a> <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/ending-an-interlude/5738057374367744">home</a>, but the first one I'll actually get to live in (my family lives in the other two, on the east coast). I don't know how many homes you need before you get to call yourself a "real estate mogul", but I'm feelin' pretty mogul-y.</em></p>
<p>***<em class="small">The things that make it "habitable" are the skylight, interior door, and maybe insulation. Aside from that, it's just a normal box truck in all-around good condition.</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Being back in the truck wouldn't <em>really</em> be complete without some semi-inexplicable phenomenon causing me troubles (<a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/strange-times-in-truck-town/5756035713204224">cough cough</a>). And thankfully, the truck hasn't disappointed. I say this because I came back to the truck a few days ago to several large mounds of thick, sticky sap on the floor of the truck.</p>
<p>This would be odd under normal circumstances, but to make things further befuddling:</p>
<ul>
<li>My sunroof was closed, and</li>
<li>I wasn't parked anywhere near a tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certifiably odd. But years of strange truck happenstances mean that my first reaction was along the lines of "This needs to be gone <strong>now</strong>", instead of just general confusion. I've witnessed one too many <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/pest-problems/5759778777202688">ant <sup>et al</sup> infestations</a> even <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-1-no-food/5643440998055936">without any food in the truck</a>, I sure as hell wasn't going to sit around and find out if they find sap tasty or not.*</p>
<p>So I busted out the cleaning products and scrubbed, scraped, or otherwise scooped up the sap. Once that was done, I was ready to be confused and/or befuddled.</p>
<h2>A Grand Theory</h2>
<p>Okay, so I've got a rough idea of what actually happened here. For a while leading up to the incident, I was indeed parked under a tree. Usually, I'm a big fan of trees, the shade and CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and general ancestral predisposition toward them and whatnot. This tree however, not so much. It is a sappy, rude tree.** I don't believe that trees feel emotions in the same way that humans do, but if this tree could feel anything, I'd imagine it would feel nothing but unmitigated spite. It truly seems like this thing was purpose-built by nature to remove happiness from the world. As far as I can tell, this tree has two main hobbies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dropping infinitely sticky, gum-like sap bombs</li>
<li>Coating the world in pine needles, at a rate that logistically doesn't seem possible</li>
</ol>
<p>I know I'm really hamming up the tree description here, but it'd be hard for me to overstate just how obnoxious the sap  was. I'd hear it dropping at steady intervals, a substantive *<em>thunk</em>* on the thin metal roof. After a few days parked in the same spot, the sap was so thick on the sunroof that it no longer let light in. The potent combination of sap and pine needles made the truck absolutely filthy, and running the windshield wipers with torrents of washer fluid barely made a dent. I had to spray down the truck with a pressure washer to get most of it off. This whole sappy-mound-in-the-truck ordeal played out <em>after</em> I had already cleaned the truck. But anyway, here's what I think happened, in haiku form:</p>
<br/>
<div class="text-center">
Sap on the rooftop<br/>
Pine needles invade the cracks<br/>
Summer heat, sap melts.
</div>
<br/>
<p>Basically, pine needles crept into the (usually waterproof) crevice between the sunroof glass and the liner, leaving a really small gap. One exceptionally hot day melted the sap on the roof (which I couldn't reach to clean off with the pressure washer) and it proceeded to seep through the gaps and plop onto the floor, where it cooled and solidified into a hateful mound.</p>
<p>And sure enough, when I took out the sunroof glass and swept a cloth around the crevice where the truck roof meets the sunroof bracket, it was <strong>full</strong> of pine needles. With that out of the way, a quick  and preemptive Q &amp; A.</p>
<h2>A Quick and Preemptive Q&amp;A</h2>
<p><strong><em>Why did you park there in the first place?</em></strong></p>
<p>I didn't know what I was signing up for.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why didn't you move the truck once you realized it was getting covered in sap?</em></strong></p>
<p>Pure laziness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where are the pictures? I DEMAND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE</em></strong></p>
<p>I took one photo <em>afterwards</em> if that counts:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rLQO07GwlqEbMbRI0pI_YL44rxzIq8p0K1EZBJbcPAwebml58ooeD2_vh-6vBJ8g2n4GFlxCDZ-ntaV-wgBXZdtAWowD8rURdXRT_zKFTRFJ2knn=s450"/>
<p>A corner of the screen where sap streamed through, one of the mounds was directly below it.</p>
</div>
<h2>Of Trucks and Troubles</h2>
<p>As always, the truck shows an infinite capacity to be problematic in new and exciting ways. This is as entertaining as it is annoying. Especially after the long and relatively problem-free hiatus, I don't mind being kept on my toes a bit. Plus, how else would I get fed fodder to fuel this feed? (Okay, okay, I'll stop now.)</p>
<p>*<em class="small">This is all a long-winded explanation for why I don't have any pictures of the mounds of sap. Years of truck blogging apparently still haven't instilled any instinct to take photos first and destroy evidence later.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">As you can probably imagine from the context, I'm talking about "sappy" as in "produces a lot of physical sap," as opposed to "enjoyed the movie The Notebook".</em></p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>To be honest, it's been kinda weird trying to maintain a blog about living in a truck when I haven't, you know, been living in a truck.</p>
<p class="text-center">It's sure a good thing I'm back in the truck then.</p>
<p>Yup, you <del>heard</del> read that right. After <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/pandemic-in-a-box/5718138591117312">a long, long year</a> (and some change), I've sloughed off the normalcy of a one-bedroom apartment and slithered back into my truckly digs of yesteryear. And while the amenities and convenience of things like "electricity" and a "bathroom" and "not living in a legal grey area" were nice additions to my life, I've got to say that I'm glad to be back.</p>
<p><em>But Brandon, you were <strong>this</strong> close to being a well-adjusted member of society, what happened?</em></p>
<p>For starters, offices opened back up, which was really the main thing holding me back. As a rampant pragmatist, living in a vehicle has usually been about making good use of the resources available to me. And it turns out that tech offices are <em>pretty great</em> resources. But more directly, I think the truck <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-question-of-time/5746311907246080">still makes sense</a> in the larger context of my life and goals, at least for the time being. Plus, I think I'd regret not giving the truck one last hurrah. How long will this last hurrah last? Who knows. Probably somewhere between a month and a year, I see a couple things on the horizon that might change the whole "does this still make sense?" equation. In any case, I'll let future Brandon take stock of the situation and make a call on that one.</p>
<h2>The Situation</h2>
<p>A lot has changed since the last time I was truckin' it, the main thing being that I <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-switch-up-v2/5737999606218752">traded the comforts of my cushy big-company job</a> for a comparatively scrappy, single-digit-number-of-people startup. I'm not walking distance from a dozen different buildings I can go into, I don't have cafes making me my every meal, yada yada. The new office is a unit in a larger business park, which changes the rules of engagement a bit. All in all, it's definitely required a bit of adaptation.</p>
<p>Because I'm consistently tardy with my posts, I've actually already been living my new truck life for like two months, and I think I've settled into a decent rhythm. I wake up around 5:30ish, bike ~15 minutes over to the office, hit the gym, shower, cook myself breakfast, and start my day.</p>
<h3>Breakfast?</h3>
<p>Breakfast, indeed. The office has got a microwave and a fridge, and that's enough to make some microwave egg sandwiches,* and oatmeal with peanut butter. For the uninitiated, I know the phrase "microwave egg sandwiches" might sound a bit <em>odd</em>, but they're legitimately fine, and a useful tool in anyone's van life cookbook. One can find any number of recipes online, so I won't do you the disservice of trying to explain my probably mediocre variant. Not much needs to be said about oatmeal with peanut butter, it's delicious and nutritious and probably the closest thing I have these days to a religion.</p>
<h3>Gym?</h3>
<p>I've previously <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/playing-with-fire-giant-rubber-bands/5756330996400128">detailed</a> what I'd been doing for "exercise" within the confines of the pandemic. It amounted to aggressively deforming rubber bands and biking like I actually had a place to be. Prior to that, I'd been doing <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/picking-things-up-and-putting-them-down/5651874166341632">basically the same routine</a> with slight variations for over a decade.</p>
<p>When I first saw the gym at the new office, I almost wept tears of joy. I didn't know if there was a gym <em>at all</em>, and if there was one, I was expecting the kind of gyms you see in hotels, which have a few decrepit treadmills, dumbbells between 2 and 17 pounds, and <em>maybe</em> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_machine">Smith machine</a>. What I actually found was a fully loaded fitness center with not one, but two (!!) power racks, which is really all I need for my daily ritual of picking things up and putting them down. It took some MacGyver-ing to get the safety pins at the right height for every exercise so I can do them safely without a spotter, but with that squared away, I haven't had any problems. I'm very happy, and, after a year+ of not lifting, very sore.</p>
<h3>Everything Else</h3>
<p>The other main thing that has changed for me is what I do outside of work. In the Before Times, I had access to a vast campus where I could amble around and do whatever away from my team, and I spent most of my free time in an unrelated-to-my-day-job building in a cozy and quiet corner, reading a book or working on any number of esoteric projects. But now, there's not really anywhere obvious for me to go after I've put in my eight-or-so hours. I <em>could</em> go back to the truck, but at ~4pm it's still like 120 degrees, which isn't great. Plus, the whole point of the truck is that I don't spend time in the truck, so if I'm spending time in the truck, that seems&#8230;wrong? Instead of that, I <em>could</em> hang out in the business park courtyard, but my co-workers would be able to see me from the window, which would blow my cover, or at least encourage all sorts of questions that I don't have great <del>answers</del> bold-faced lies for.</p>
<p>My solution has been to rediscover libraries. This happens to me probably once every five years or so, when I remember that libraries exist and am completely blown away at what an incredible resource they are. So after work most days, I'll bike ~15 minutes to a nearby library (which I picked up a library card for), and do my usual shenanigans there. Sometime around 8pm, I'll bike back to the office, get myself ready for bed, and head back to the truck.</p>
<h2>All in All</h2>
<p>I'm glad to be back. I appreciate the regimentation the truck provides for my schedule, and the bike ride to/from work and the library ensures that I'm vastly more active than I have been for the past year and a half. I know that it's not something I'll be doing forever, but I'll be damned if I don't enjoy it while I'm here.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I learned about the concept of microwaving eggs from an on-again off-again van-dwelling friend of mine. I was incredulous at the idea such a thing could be good, but Srini made me a believer. So thanks Srini!</em></p>

<p>
I can be a completely insufferable person to be around. Part of this is because it took me a <strong>long</strong> time to learn the difference between someone seeking advice, and just wanting to vent. If I think I see a problem, I tend to look for solutions. Couple that with a bit of obnoxious optimism and an inclination towards simplicity, and the outcome is that I trivialize problems and offer deeply <strong>un</strong>nuanced "solutions".
</p>
<p>Case in point: whenever someone complains about rain, I mechanically regurgitate some devastatingly clich&#233; remark about how, without the rain, we wouldn't appreciate the sunshine.</p>
<p>Now, if they were just trying make conversation or kvetch, this is normally the point in the conversation where their eyes would roll back in their head so hard they'd be doing an impressive impression of a slot machine.</p>
<p>Even still, I think it's a valid point (fully acknowledging that I overdo it a bit). After all, us human beans spent the past four billion years* getting really good at handling whatever the universe threw at us, and the net result is that our experiences don't exist in absolute terms of "good" and "bad", but are instead relative to some ever-shifting baseline. If every single day was a perfect 73&#176; F and sunny (or substitute your own particular perfect weather), we'd learn to complain on the rare day where it was an absolutely abysmal 7<em>2</em>&#176; F and partly cloudy (but still mostly sunny).</p>
<p>If you think I'm being dramatic, you've likely never lived in the Bay Area &#8212; that example was plucked from something I witnessed on many a mostly-sunny-day.</p>
<p>Anyway, all I'm saying is that rain helps set a baseline and add perspective. An "oh, so it could be worse". A poor man's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_visualization">negative visualization</a>, if you will. And if you won't, that's fine too.</p>
<p>Anyway anyway, that's what this post aspires to be about: the wonderful world of less-than-ideal things.</p>
<h2>The Best Medicine</h2>
<p>I've dedicated <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/tag/%23TruckProblems">a decent chunk of this blog</a> to the times when things have gone suboptimally, awry, or just downright wrong. This is partly because writing about things going <em>right</em> would be significantly less interesting, we're all suckers for a good tragedy. But more than that, things frequently just don't go the way we expect them to go, which is doubly true when trying to live out of things not explicitly designed for living in, like box trucks. As such, I think it's useful to have some kind of framework for reasoning about undesirable outcomes. I never explicitly sat down and thought about how to handle things going wrong (until now, I guess), but I find myself coming back to the same few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad Things&#8482; are rarely existential.</strong> Take an objective look at the Bad Thing you're currently dealing with. Will it matter in 10 seconds? 10 minutes? 10 days?** Usually, the answer to at least one of those questions is no, in which case you can just mentally fast-forward to the point at which it no longer matters, and save the energy you would have spent stressing over it. For the occasionally cataclysmic Big Bad Thing where it really <em>does</em> matter, even in the long run, your energy is likely better spent on figuring out how to deal with this life-altering incident than feeling bad about it.</li>
<li><strong>Adversity provides opportunities for growth.</strong> We grow when we step outside our comfort zone. Bad things are perhaps necessarily uncomfortable, or they probably wouldn't be considered bad. Therefore, dealing with Bad Things makes us more capable human beings, which seems like a Good Thing. Every time my bike or car or truck has broken down, I learn something new about how to fix them. Same for software things at work. Minor inconveniences build character and patience, etc, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Things going according to plan is straight up boring.</strong> You ever read a book or watch a movie about someone having a great day and then living happily ever after? Probably not, because that would be a pretty uninteresting book/movie. On some level, it's because we <em>like</em> complications. Why not take it one step further and apply it to our own lives? Getting your car towed isn't a <em>problem</em>, it's a <em>plot point</em>. Enjoy the adventure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The upshot is that I've Stockholm Syndrome'd (or Pavlov'd? I'm not a psychologist) myself to laugh reflexively when things go wrong. Bonus points if <em>I'm</em> the reason they went wrong. The worse things go (up to a point, naturally), the more hilarious it is. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stubbed a toe? Gentle snicker.</li>
<li>Car won't start? Light chuckle.</li>
<li>Ripped my pants in public? Hearty laugh.</li>
<li>Dropped an entire pot of baked beans? Roaring cackle.</li>
<li>Biking uphill in a freak rainstorm? Abject hysterics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laughter is chicken soup for the soul. Or vegetable soup, if that's more your thing. In either case, there are few problems so existential in nature that they're worth not-laughing about, and I'd prefer to laugh than be stressed, given the option. And that option is pretty much always on the table, especially if we know we'll get over whatever it is we're dealing with. I think folks frequently underestimate how much of a choice it really is to be stressed out or overwhelmed. "Just don't be stressed" is definitely one of those un-nuanced oversimplifications I'm oh-so-fond of, but at the end of the day, we're really the only ones responsible for how we feel.</p>
<p>Aside from uncontrollable laughter, my other favorite antidote for adversity is apathy. Over the past few years, I've found that I have less and less energy that I'm willing to dedicate to feeling bad about things. In the grand scheme of things, life is pretty short, mustering up the energy to be petty or upset or stressed or down on myself just doesn't seem as gratifying as it did when I was an angsty teenager. As a result, I consider fewer things problems than I otherwise might have in the past. Things that were problems are now just exciting detours that will make great stories later.</p>
<h2>Making Misteaks</h2>
<p>A special subset of "things going wrong" is "things going wrong <strong>because of you</strong>". I don't mean to brag, but I'm really good at messing things up and finding myself in that latter category, which folks usually call "mistakes". At one point or another, I've messed up pretty much anything I've ever done in <em>some</em> way. Whether its crashing cars, falling off bikes, making bad investments, ruining important relationships, breaking software systems, or any manner of truck-related tragedies, I've had my fair share of personal failures.</p>
<p>If you've been reading my ramblings for a while, it might not come as a surprise to to hear that I'm pretty proud of (most of) my blunders, and more than happy to document them in an unnecessarily public forum. That's because, in my mind, mistakes are a Good Thing&#8482;. Being bad at something is usually the first step to being good at something &#8212; it's a lot easier to learn from failure than from success. Through that lens, getting things wrong usually means I'm doing something right.</p>
<p>The only failures I truly regret are ones where I'm not the only person I hurt, or where I've made the <em>exact</em> same mistake more than once. The former one doesn't require any more elaboration***, and the latter means that I didn't learn <em>anything</em> from my mistake the first time. And publicly documenting my mistakes has the added benefit of making me (slightly) more accountable for those mistakes, and less likely to repeat them, at least in theory.</p>
<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>Recently, I've been reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">this book</a>**** about "antifragility", a way of describing systems that benefit from volatility (usually to some finite extent). The human immune system is a prime example &#8212; not only can it <em>handle</em> stressors (viruses, bacteria, etc), which would merely indicate robustness, but it actually <em>benefits</em> from such stressors, mounting a more effective response the next time around.</p>
<p>I only mention this because I think the same way about bad things more generally: anything that forces us outside our comfort zone is naturally an opportunity for future resilience, which is just a convoluted way of saying it makes us better people. I find the prospect worth smiling about.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I recognize that human beans have only been around for about three hundred thousand years in their current bean form, but I imagine that we were also picking up useful adaptations as monkeys and mice and amoebas in our prior incarnations.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">I use a different number (e.g. 7) and different units (e.g. jiffies? microfortnights? dog years?) every time, because 1) I can't remember what it was when I originally heard it, and 2) the actual amounts of time are mostly irrelevant, it's the underlying idea that this thing doesn't matter long-term that's important.</em></p>
<p>***<em class="small">For all you sociopaths who need an explanation: it's because hurting people is bad.</em></p>
<p>****<em class="small">The author's got some pretty strong opinions on a wide range of topics. It probably goes without saying, but I don't necessarily agree with him on all of them.</em></p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>
It seems like <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-switch-up/5670405876482048">just yesterday</a> I was switching subsidiary companies at my resident multinational conglomerate, trading in my gig in enterprise business software for something more acutely interesting to me: surgical robotics.
</p>
<p>
And the three+ intervening years have been not only a grand ole time, but also marked a clear shift in what I actually <em>do</em> at work. The last time I wrote a post like this, my main job was building the things other people told me to build. Over time, I became the person who decides what to build and how to build it,* and I've learned quite a bit in that process: how to build big (and hopefully useful) systems, how to lead teams and (again, hopefully) not have them hate you, and a whole bunch of more specific things (working with a variety of cloud platforms, building protocols for embedded devices, working with teams across timezones, etc).
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't consider myself a particularly career-oriented person,** but if you spend 40+ hours a week &#8212; 35% of your waking hours &#8212; doing <em>anything</em>, you kind of have a vested interest in doing it well. Or at least in a way that doesn't make you hate doing it. And from that perspective I'm happy with the way my role has changed over time.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, by now you can probably see where this post is going: I've thrown all of that away and I'm joining a small startup.
</p>
<h2>But Why?</h2>
<p>
A great question, with a decidedly less good answer: I have no idea. I've found a bunch of different ways to rationalize why the change makes sense, but at the end of the day, I left a job that I really enjoyed, with a great team and clear growth opportunities, for something a bit more nebulous (and took a significant pay cut in the process). And it's not even like the new job is "building automated prosthetic limbs for orphans" or "systems for cheaply purifying water in low-income nations" or something similarly altruistic sounding to throw around at cocktail parties: it's more or less your standard Silicon Valley (or <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/">Silicon Valley</a></em>) fare.
</p>
<h2>An Array of Rationalizations</h2>
<p>
Here's the current list of ways I've attempted to justify why I joined a new company, in literally no order whatsoever.
</p>
<h3>Risk vs Reward</h3>
<p>
Pretty much every decision we make is about <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/trade-offs/5684961520648192">trade-offs</a>, and how we weigh the different pros and cons is fundamental to who we are as people. One parameter I'm constantly tweaking is how much risk I'm willing to take in different areas of my own life. Naturally, finance is a big one, and I've traditionally played that one fairly safe - investing almost exclusively in low-cost index funds, with the occasional real estate purchase just to showcase how little of a plan I actually have. But as time goes on and I've built up a bit of a financial safety net, I'm more willing to take on more risk (e.g. by joining a startup), theoretically with a corresponding increase in reward, which leads us to my next rationalization.
</p>
<h3>An Alignment of Incentives</h3>
<p>
One thing that I find attractive about the new opportunity is that I have a not-insignificant stake in the company. Further, the work that I do (or don't do) has a real effect on the success or failure of the company as a whole, which dictates if that equity ends up actually being worth anything.
</p>
<p>
Now, as always, money isn't particularly motivating to me (beyond what I need to Not Die&#8482;), since I'm not eager to buy anything except my own financial independence. But (also as always), money confers flexibility, and even if I don't personally want to do anything with money, I can always give it to organizations that can use it to <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/truck-tenets-at-the-core/5164606641143808">generate some happiness</a> in the world.
</p>
<h3>"Market Research"</h3>
<p>
I think the <em>worst</em> time to start looking for a job is when you're unhappy with your current one, or worse, when you've just lost it. Similar to not going grocery shopping when you're hungry, I think it's much easier to objectively evaluate an opportunity when you have a happy baseline to compare it to. As such, over the 5+ years I spent at my last company, I interviewed with 10-15 different places: doing interviews, getting offers, negotiating, and ultimately, rejecting those offers. I always explained to companies upfront that I was happy with my current role, but also that I was open to exploring (and perhaps taking) a new opportunity if I thought it was a good fit.
</p>
<p>
While I advocate this practice to everyone, I think it's especially useful in software engineering, where interviews frequently bear little resemblance to what you're actually doing on a day-to-day basis. Skills like "whiteboard coding" and "answering contrived and artificially constrained new grad Computer Science questions" just aren't things one will be good at without a bit of exposure beforehand. Similarly, negotiating is a tricky and fraught endeavor with uneven power dynamics, so it helps to train that muscle as well.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this is all to say that of all the companies I interviewed with, this latest one was the first where the full picture of the opportunity was enough to make me consider leaving my previous team. I mean that's a given now, since I <em>did</em> leave my previous team, but you get the idea.
</p>
<h3>Worst Case Scenario</h3>
<p>
Whenever I'm trying to evaluate a tough choice, I pretend I'm trying to help <em>someone else</em> evaluate the choice, and then I walk myself through the advice I'd give to them (read: me). In this case, I came up with something along the lines of:
</p>
<blockquote>
In the worst case scenario: the company is unsuccessful and folds, perhaps in a dramatic fashion featuring (metaphorical) explosions. To really underscore this worst case scenario, let's even assume that the company folded as a direct result of your own personal and/or professional incompetence. In this scenario, you just go grovelling back to your previous team (who has already said they'd happily take you back), or some other well-established company. You have the safety net to handle a bout of unemployment with fairly little fuss.
</blockquote>
<p>From that perspective, why not give it a go?</p>
<h3>Learnin'</h3>
<p>
Aside from an income (and thus, to belabor the point here, Not Dying&#8482;), the thing I'm probably looking for most out of a job is the ability to learn and grow. And while there was still plenty to learn in my previous job, I'd kind of settled into a rhythm with each new project, so while the number of projects was increasing, the actual shape of them was substantially similar.
</p>
<p>
Aside from working in a new domain (video compression), I'm also working with new requirements, new sets of trade-offs, and new cloud providers. At my previous company, I'd often heard that the process of joining and ramping up was like "drinking from a firehose" because of the sheer amount of stuff you take in over the course of the first few weeks. I've definitely had that sensation all over again at the new job, which I consider a success.
</p>
<h3>Codin'</h3>
<p>
As I took on more organizational responsibilities on my previous team (leading meetings, answering emails, ramping up other engineers, etc), I had correspondingly less time to actually build stuff myself. For a while, it was easy for me to rationalize this as "but I'm helping other people be productive, so the net result is far larger than anything I could produce on my own", but after a point, I just (perhaps selfishly) wanted to build the darn thing myself.
</p>
<p>
In my first month at the new gig, I wrote vastly more code than I had in the previous year at my last job. The small size of the company means everyone has their own well-defined niche, which means there's far less coordination overhead, which means I more or less spend 8 hours a day heads down in a world of my own. This will (theoretically) change over time as the company (hopefully) grows and scales things up, at which point I'll start to take on more of my old duties, but I'm quite enjoying the current state of things.
</p>
<h3>But More Realistically...</h3>
<p>
Like I said before, I think all of the above is just me conveniently retrofitting reasons onto a decision I don't fully understand. Realistically, I might have just gotten bored of staring at the same four walls every day, which provides far less dynamism than I'm used to. Through that lens, switching jobs might just have been a subconscious way to rebel against that and shake things up a bit. Who knows?
</p>
<h2>What about the Truck?</h2>
<p>
One thing that I've tiptoed around for years is where I actually worked, going so far as to scrub the name from my earlier posts. That said, I never did a particularly good job of this, and it's <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/origins/5629499534213120">pretty</a> <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/back-to-california/5707702298738688">obvious</a> to anyone paying <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/looking-forward/5178081291534336">attention</a> that I worked at Google.
</p>
<p>
My main motivation for not advertising it so loudly was to avoid the impression that I was profiting off the name of my employer, and to avoid (erhm, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/moving-out-the-wild-west/5647308616105984">further</a>) conversations with HR. I've mentioned before that I actually <em>lose</em> money running this blog,*** since I haven't monetized it at all. But still, appearances and whatnot.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this is all to say: a lot of my initial truckliness was predicated on access to the resources I had at Google: food, gyms, bathrooms, etc. Hell, I was even keeping the truck "discreetly" tucked away in the back of an unused Google parking lot since the pandemic began.
</p>
<p>
But now I've gone and messed that up by quitting, which opens up a whole host of messy questions and logistics for me to figure out. Things like "where do I keep the truck?", or even more existential, "do I keep the truck at all?"
</p>
<p>
My current plan, which I reserve the right to toss out and start from scratch, is:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Store the truck <em>somewhere</em> for the remaining, interminable duration of the pandemic, then</li>
<li>Attempt an even more stripped-down truck life than before.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In fact, I've already gone ahead and done #1, though I expect it'll be some number of months before I can start to actuate on #2, working remotely from a truck being a bit difficult and all that.
</p>
<h2>Everything Else</h2>
<p>
Naturally, leaving the safety and comfort of Google has broader implications for my life and plans. Things like financial independence/early retirement, longer-term truckin' stuff, and my ideas on what I'm looking for in different parts of my life are all subject to change. I've got half-baked thoughts on all those things that I'll probably turn into 65%-baked thoughts before I plop them onto my little corner of the internet.
</p>
<p>*<em class="small">More of a focus on the "how to build it" part. Choosing which products to build was always outside of my realm (as it should be), but I had a lot more discretion to choose what got built in terms of systems to power a given product.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">Plus, with any luck, my 'career' will be shorter than usual. Early retirement/financial independence ambitions and whatnot.</em></p>
<p>***<em class="small">An extremely modest amount of money, like "avocado toast and a latte once a month" kind of money. An ongoing blog rewrite will (at least in theory) make it even cheaper to run.</em></p>

<h2>An Obnoxiously Long-Winded Intro</h2>
<p>I'm a firm believer that human consciousness is a huge cosmic accident. Kinda like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2wVqOD2-zI">Matthew McConaughey's monologue from that one scene in <em>True Detective</em></a>. Except far, far less cynical, and maybe without the part about humans choosing to voluntarily go extinct. Great scene though, great scene.</p>
<p>More to the point: not only do people exist, but we're painfully aware of our own existence as somewhat autonomous entities. We aren't particularly amenable to going through mechanical, preprogrammed motions as effectively as say, an ant. We get bored easily. To keep ourselves entertained, we ascribe higher meaning to things and give ourselves purpose.</p>
<p>A lot of times, this purpose isn't something that we call out explicitly, it's just something that happens. Things like "be good at my job" or "provide for my family". When our purpose isn't clear or we don't think we can carry it out, sometimes we'll just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_of_despair">straight up die</a>. Fragile things, we are.</p>
<p>All of this in mind, my personal feeling is that it's a good idea to take a more active interest in the Purpose Picking Process&#8482;, as it's a key part of Not Dying&#8482;. I'm talking about taking the time, doing the soul-searching, and <em>really</em> figuring out what you think it is that makes you tick.</p>
<p>I know, I know, that's an obnoxiously long-winded intro, but I swear I'm going somewhere with this. This post is about what makes <em>me</em> tick, the idea being that I can use that to structure my life and evaluate my actions and all that jazz.</p>
<h2>Tick, tock</h2>
<blockquote>
One day, you opened up your eyes<br/>
Inside of you<br/>
Inside a world<br/>
Inside a universe<br/>
You didn't get to choose<br/>
<br/>
You didn't get to pick the rules<br/>
Or pick the past<br/>
Or set the pace<br/>
Or cast the cast and crew<br/>
You didn't get to pick your starting place<br/>
<br/>
And though it was a race<br/>
You didn't understand<br/>
You simply lined up on the blocks<br/>
And when the pistol popped<br/>
You ran.<br/>
<br/>
&#8212;Watsky, <em>Talking to Myself</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from just being an all-around solid piece of <del>prose</del> poetry, I think this lyric nicely sums up the overarching sense of purpose I've picked for myself.</p>
<p>Because the fact of the matter is that we <em>don't</em> get to choose where we're born, or even that we're born at all. We pop into existence entirely of someone else's accord. We take whatever hand the universe has dealt for us. And we do our darnedest.</p>
<p>And statistically speaking, <em>a lot</em> of people are dealt <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/wash_statistics.html">truly terrible hands</a>. Which isn't to say life is a cakewalk for everyone else. Even if you were dealt a halfway decent hand, by being born relatively healthy in a relatively wealthy nation for instance, life still has its fair share of hardships. And they have a curious habit of all piling on at the least convenient times.</p>
<h3>The Thesis</h3>
<p>So, in summary: nobody chose to be here, and everyone is doing what they can and working with what they've got. When we interact with people, we have quite a bit of control over how we affect their happiness. The <em>least</em> we can do is to not take some away. My goal is to maybe sometimes even add some more, using the relative autonomy granted to me. That's my sincere belief: happiness is not a zero-sum game, you can add happiness without taking it from somewhere else.</p>
<h2>Why Happiness</h2>
<p><a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy">I don't think happiness is the be-all, end-all of human emotion</a>. Our brains are capable of a bewildering range of complex and nuanced emotion, and I think it's up to everyone to figure out the combination and balance of brain-chemicals that works for them, and to figure out how to get their brain to produce them. Having said that, happiness still has some universal appeal, and it's usually one of the easier-to-invoke emotions in other people, even in fairly fleeting interactions.</p>
<h2>Why People</h2>
<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'm very much an introvert. In a pre-COVID world, I'd regularly go weeks at a time without actively seeking any social engagement outside of work. And from that frame of reference, it seems strange even to myself that I should make my overarching purpose related to other people at all. Why not make it about building the best blog? Or being wickedly strong?</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I have a great answer for this, but if I had to pick one, it'd go something like this: Nobody is an island. No one exists in a vacuum, even though some of us might wish that we did from time to time. Doing literally anything of sufficient scale will always require working with other people, because no matter how good you are at something, a big group of people will always be able to get more done. You're 10x better than the average person? Cool, a group of 11 people can do it better. That's just math.</p>
<p>So I think it makes sense to structure my core beliefs around how I deal with people.</p>
<h2>A Decently Succinct Outro</h2>
<p>So that's that. I've hitched my identity to "hopefully not making others more miserable". Future <em>Truck Tenets</em> posts will ostensibly talk about what that means. Hopefully in less abstract, more tangible ways.</p>

<h2>A Cry for Help</h2>
<p>Several eons ago, when quarantine started, a younger and slightly more naive Brandon <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/pandemic-in-a-box/5718138591117312">entered quarantine</a> with a bike, a yoga mat, and a well-intentioned (but ultimately wrong) hope that this wouldn't last more than a few weeks.</p>
<p>And the biking/yoga combo (boga? yiking?) served its purpose well, but as the days and weeks wore on, it became increasingly clear that it wouldn't be enough. I was still shedding weight, and while my lower body was in fine shape, my upper body had become soft and sad from a clear lack of stimulation. Not quite "Christian Bale in <em>The Machinist</em>" bad, but bad enough that multiple people independently pointed out that I looked much smaller, in an "I'm worried about you, is this a cry for help?" kind of way. Worse, I could <em>feel</em> that I was physically weaker.*</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y_Oedph_xQzFPOJQQxAJxhkHBbPnk9stUeU7VOcTJj8qUt0jjyRi83L2fsoNCJjvJv3RcB4vTMLEYlfbWTl3jAFDKgQddSPma6MT=s350"/>
<p>Me a few weeks ago.<br/>I was originally going to put an image of Christian Bale from <em>The Machinist</em> here, but all the images I found were slightly too grotesque for my taste. If you're unfamiliar with the film and curious of what I'm talking about, you can search for the film at your own risk.<br/>From what I remember, it's a weird one.</p>
</div>
<h2>Re-inflation</h2>
<p>Like most people, I didn't enjoy the prospect of being a deflated shell of my former self, but it didn't seem like there were a lot of options. An at-home power rack would have been ideal, but not particularly practical when I was house-hopping. Even now that I've settled into a place (for the time being), Bay Area apartments aren't known for being overly spacious. A gym would also work, but they've been about as consistent as federal guidance on mask wearing. That is to say: I can't really rely on gyms to be open just yet.</p>
<p>And just when I thought all hope was lost, something happened &#8212; a reader (thanks Christoph!) reached out and suggested I try resistance bands, noting that they had started using them as an alternative to traditional in-gym strength training when quarantine started.</p>
<p>To say I was skeptical would be an understatement. In my mind, resistance bands were for the injured, the elderly, and apparently also my mother, who doesn't really fit into either of those categories. From my perspective, they certainly weren't for folks serious about strength training. Strength training required Large Metal Structures&#8482; and Plates&#8482; and Grunting&#8482; and Angry Faces&#8482; and Toxic Masculinity&#8482;, not GiAnT StReTcHy BaNdS.<p>
<p>But after a few emails back and forth, Christoph had convinced me otherwise. He showed me some videos  showcasing resistance band variants of all the usual strength training staples: military press, bench press, squat, and deadlift. So I bit the bullet, and ordered a set of resistance bands.</p>
<h2>An Adjustment Period</h2>
<p>I've said it before and I'll surely say it again: I am a creature of habit. I've been doing more or less <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/picking-things-up-and-putting-them-down/5651874166341632">the same workout routine</a> for nearly a decade at this point. And from that perspective, switching things up naturally required a bit of adjustment.</p>
<p>For starters, I'm used to calculating out the weight for each set down to 5 pound increments, meaning I'm shuffling comically small 2.5 pound plates on and off the bar. Resistance bands don't operate that way. There's not really the concept of <em>weight</em>. Instead, there's a similar (but much fuzzier) concept, <em>resistance</em>. You choose resistance by selecting a band (Extra Light, Light, Medium, Heavy, Extra Heavy), and sometimes by where you grip the band (closer to the anchor point == more resistance). Instead of moving the weight, the focus is on getting a peak contraction, i.e. doing the exercise through the full range of motion with proper form and focusing on muscle engagement.</p>
<p>And that's all well and fine, but it doesn't appeal to the more mathematically inclined part of me, the part that wants to empirically measure my progress. Spit-balling the resistance per set means I can vary things as I go, which is nice, but it also means the quality of my workout is subject to how willing I am to grab the bands in a way to maximize resistance. I'm a person who firmly believes that human motivation and willpower are flaky and fleeting constructs that shouldn't be relied on, and instead, one's environment should be set up to make achieving the desired outcome easier. As such, putting the onus of a <em>hard</em> workout on myself instead of baking it into the pre-calculated weights didn't sit well with me.</p>
<p>My strategy has been to institute rough guidelines for myself ahead of time, like "for the second set, grab lower on the band than on the first set", or "use the Medium band for the first set, then use the Heavy band for the next set". These get written down in a shorthand notation in my workout log in the same way I used to write down weights per set in a pre-COVID world. It's not quite the same as my old barbell routine, but it adds a nice set of guardrails to keep me honest.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Uc8XMZ5C1phpdM0yoWzHkjCY05Lawv8hy5U79gf_u-REqcSV9awg6v9yuRTWDRnRjcqqmHaTfqN8WGXwp2RYSb1DW7aI9uQ_4-KS=s650"/>
<p>This past week's band workouts.</p>
</div>
<h2>In a Routine</h2>
<p>At this point, I've been doing resistance band workouts five days per week for about six weeks, each workout being about 45 minutes to an hour depending on how much I'm dilly dallying. The bands I purchased came with a seven day trial of a three month, strength-training-focused fitness program. I used this trial period to take <em>diligent</em> notes on the whole three month training program, which I've saved on my phone and refer to for each workout.</p>
<p>As for the routine itself, I've actually been pretty happy with it. I try to minimize the rest time between sets to make it a little more cardiovascular-ly stimulating, and I end each workout feeling appropriately tired/pumped. I'm sore in all the right ways and places again, and I'm even sore in some new places. There's more volume (e.g. repetitions) than I'm used to, which makes sense since you can't really match the weight of traditional strength training without putting a dangerous amount of energy into the band, which could snap back and really do some damage.</p>
<p>Speaking of damage, the bands also have this fun quality where they will rip the skin clean off your hands. This also makes sense. Unlike barbell/dumbbell exercises where the weight is distributed evenly across your hands, with resistance bands, most the resistance is applied at the sides of your hands. On my second or third day of using the bands, I accidentally tore small chunks out of each hand between my thumb and index finger. I ordered gloves that day, and wrapped my hands in band-aids and ACE bandages for the few intervening days. It took weeks to heal properly and I'm in no hurry to make that mistake again.</p>
<h2>Other Benefits</h2>
<p>Aside from guiding me back to my old size and shape, the bands have given me one other much appreciated benefit: an easy way of exercising on the go. This is a tool that has been notably and painfully absent from my exercise arsenal in the past, and was especially apparent to me when I was traveling a lot for work/play/my ongoing real estate adventures. On work trips, I'd usually go to the hotel gym, get in a light jog, and do dumbbell-toting free-form jazz. This rarely felt fulfilling, but was the best I could figure out how to do. When I returned from a trip, my first few workouts always left me much, much more sore than usual, indicating that those hotel workouts hadn't really done much for me.</p>
<p>The bands are small and light enough that I can take the whole kit and caboodle with me when I'm out and about, meaning no more hotel free-form dumbell jazz, and more consistent adherence to my routine.</p>
<p>At first, the idea of resistance bands really seemed like a <em>stretch</em>, but now that I've <em>snapped</em> into a routine, I can honestly say that I'm <del>elastic</del> ecstatic about having found a viable at-home alternative to barbell strength training.**</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Truck Tenets is a series I've been wanting to do for a while. Like, a <em>while</em> &#8212; I've got draft posts dating back to 2016. It's only by my sheer inability to see anything through to completion that none of them have seen the light of day&#8230;until now.</p>
<p>The idea behind the series is pretty straightforward: there are ideas that I live my life by, why not talk about them? Some are high-level and abstract, like "Less is more", and others are more concrete, like "Don't eat gas station sushi in land-locked countries"*. Some of them come directly from my experiences with the truck, and others just as a matter of living and doing Normal Human Things&#8482;.</p>
<p>Talking about these things isn't particularly new for me. Even when I'm not <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-bit-of-philosophy/5724160613416960">talking directly about what I believe in</a>, the ideas that motivate my decisions are there, lurking in pithy asides and footnotes and implied subtexts.</p>
<p>I'm not going to pretend that the concept of having 'guiding principles' is even remotely novel or exciting, it comes up in one form or another in pretty much every one of the self-help-life-hack-be-better books I've ever read. Some examples:</p>
<p>From <em>Atomic Habits</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are&#8212;either consciously or nonconsciously.
</blockquote>
<p>From <em>Getting Things Done</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Priorities should drive your choices [...]. In order to know what your priorities are, you have to know what your work is.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><em>Horizon 5: Purpose and Principles</em> This is the big-picture view. [...] Why do you exist? What really matters to you, no matter what? The primary purpose for anything provides the core definition of what the work really is. It is the ultimate job description. All goals, visions, objectives, projects, and actions derive from this, and lead toward it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And naturally, from <em>Principles</em>:<p>
<blockquote>
Every day, each of us is faced with a blizzard of situations we must respond to. Without principles we would be forced to react to all the things life throws at us individually, as if we were experiencing each of them for the first time. If instead we classify these situations into types and have good principles for dealing with them, we will make better decisions more quickly and have better lives as a result.
</blockquote>
<p>Though really any section from <em>Principles</em> would work - it's quite literally what the book is about.</p>
<p>Anyway, all I'm trying to say is that I recognize I'm not covering any new ground here. After all, the idea is pretty intuitive: making plans and decisions is <em>a lot</em> easier when you have a consistent system for evaluating them.</p>
<p>Despite this, it's painfully clear that plenty of people haven't the slightest idea what principles are guiding their decisions. I see this in friends, family, coworkers, acquaintances, customer support folks I've had heart-to-hearts with, and cute pups at the local dog park - inconsistencies in decision-making because one doesn't have a clear idea of what's really important to them.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not going talk concretely about what my 'Truck Tenets' are in this post, since each subsequent ramblefest will tackle a different tenet. I <em>will</em> say that I think this is a particularly good time for me to be writing them though; being divorced from the truck for the past few months has given me new perspectives on where certain ideals of mine have come from.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">This last one isn't all that relevant, since I haven't had any seafood in three or so years.</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>For most folks, the past few months have likely looked a lot different than usual. Humans are <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-day-in-the-life-weekday-edition/5645478960037888">creatures of habit</a>, and spending 99% of your time stuck at home represents a pretty thorough disruption of those habits for many. As a person who was used to spending more like 0.02% of my waking hours at "home", things have certainly looked different for me. It feels like an eternity ago that I was <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/pandemic-in-a-box/5718138591117312">gearing up</a> for a life without the truck, gathering my few possessions up and picking places to stay.</p>
<h2>The <del>Stars</del> Truck Folk: Where are they now?</h2>
<p>Well, it's been three months (or maybe four?),* and in that time I've attempted to self-isolate in six or so separate spots around the Bay, each successive stay being longer as quarantine carried on. Having spent four and a half years living in a truck, I expected some growing pains. All things considered though, adjusting to the various changes in my day-to-day was surprisingly easy. </p>
<p>But then again, I guess my lifestyle is pretty conducive to self-isolating when I think about it; my favorite pastimes (reading/writing**, programming, exercising, etc) require zero human interaction. This isn't entirely by design, but it isn't exactly by chance either. Through that lens, not much has changed and my smooth transition to normal-apartment-living-human makes sense. As a Normal Apartment-Living Human&#8482; (NAH, for short), I've gone on plenty of hikes, sampled a few Napa wines, and broken a few personal records on some recent bike rides.</p>

<p>I don't want to get into the nitty gritties this time around, but it's a similar arrangement as <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-3-of-3-a-house/5696459148099584">the first one</a>, still in the Boston area, and quite lovely. Pandemics and geography naturally introduced some logistical challenges, but in the end, T's were dotted, I's were crossed, and things were generally squared away.</p>

Underlying data from <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">The New York Times</a>
</p>
</div>
<p>For better or worse (and the graphs/data tend to suggest 'worse'), it looks like my life might return to some level of normalcy in the near future. "For better" because I'm not a huge fan of Airbnb-hopping, as nice as exploring various parks and hikes around the Bay has been, and I miss my truck. "For worse" because it seems batshit insane that <em>anyone</em> should be trying to return to some level of normalcy, given the effect that appears to be having.</p>
<p>And yet, that's the direction things are trending. I got an email from Santa Clara County (<a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/covid19/Documents/executive-summary-order-07-02-2020.pdf">summarized here</a>) a few days ago that said, among other things, gyms are going to be allowed to re-open shortly. That's great for yours truly, who's been shedding weight and strength in the absence of things to pick up and put down, but I would expect gyms to be literally the <em>last</em> thing to open. I can't think of a single place where more sweaty humans take turns touching the same set of objects, aside from perhaps a McDonald's PlayPlace.</p>
<h2>Back in the Saddle?</h2>
<p>PlayPlace-related digressions aside: my repeated change of scenery hasn't been lost on my eagle-eyed co-workers, who seem to immediately pick up on the changes in lighting and the rotating backdrops of windows, paintings, and other riffraff on my video feed. My excuse has been that I'm hopping around because I don't feel productive working from my primary residence. This is more or less true&#8230;if you squint a little bit&#8230;and take a fairly liberal definition of 'primary residence'. One of those <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-switch-up/5670405876482048">conversational half-truths</a> I'm so fond of.</p>
<p>And speaking of work: my employer is starting to (slowly) phase people back into the office. Priority is for the scientists and hardware engineers, who need access to special, usually expensive, and usually immobile machinery, labs, and doodads, then the software engineers. I fall into the latter category, and appear to be slotted in the first wave of pixel-pushers heading back into the office. This seems to be at least in part because I've mentioned my reluctance to work from my actual home.</p>
<p>And on this, I am conflicted (though clearly not enough to actually <em>do</em> anything about it). Am I taking that spot in the 'first wave' from someone who legitimately has trouble working from home, perhaps for reasons other than the self-imposed and truckly ones that I have? Or have most tech folk settled into a rhythm at home and are happy to avoid the commute?</p>
<p>And further, is it even remotely reasonable of me to be going back to a (public or employer-provided) gym? Even if I'm taking sensible precautions, am I not participating in the same kind of needlessly (and decidedly not-sensible) <em>social</em> behavior that's been causing the latest (and frankly, massive) spike in cases? Between wearing a mask, wiping down equipment before and after I use it, monitoring my own health, and generally not licking other gym-goers, I'm likely not all that much of a risk, but it still feels decidedly <em>meh</em>.</p>
<p>Who knows though, if cases continue trending in the same direction, companies and counties might slow down their re-opening efforts. If so, I'll continue my circuitous shuffling around the Bay (and my strength training-deficient workout routine).</p>
<h2>What have I learned?</h2>
<p>All in all, the experience has been an <em>interesting</em> one. "Interesting" is one of those words that doesn't actually mean anything without context though, so allow me to elaborate on that. I've long talked about how <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-question-of-time/5746311907246080">I don't plan on living in the truck forever</a>, so I think this was a good reset to see how I feel about the truck. And after a few months of easy access to bathrooms and electricity, I think I've found my answer: I want more truck time.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, living in real abodes has been quite nice. I've re-discovered my love (not to be confused with knack) for cooking, where cooking is just a fancy way of saying "dousing vegetables in garlic-scented avocado oil and setting them on fire, then adding eggs". I've re-learned how to live with other humans, which is always a useful skill to have. And nobody has <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/strange-times-in-truck-town/5756035713204224">tried to watch me sleep</a> either (as far as I know), which is always a plus. </p>
<p>But the experience has also reminded me of some of the reasons I liked the truck so much to begin with. The truck added a level of regimentation to my schedule that I've struggled to replicate with willpower alone. The frequency and duration of my exercise hasn't been nearly on par without the strong motivator of being forced to travel to a gym to shower. Also, cleaning the truck was always an absolute breeze. I'd throw on some music and get to sweeping. Barely a song would pass before I was all done. Real homes just have, I don't know&#8230;<em>crevices</em>. Everywhere. There's just always another thing to clean.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's all I got for now. I've got a bunch of half-finished (and hopefully shorter) posts I'd like to publish at some point in the near future, but you know how these things go. Stay safe, and stay home.***</p>

<h2>Disclosures and Disclaimers</h2>
<p>I'm not usually one to comment on "current events".</p>
<p><em>That said</em>, when "current events" are "modern society is looking a little rough around the edges", it's kind of hard not to comment. Of course, I'm talking about <del>limited-edition Shrek Crocs</del> the COVID-19 pandemic. Now I've never aspired to be a source of information <em>or</em> disinformation, and I'd like to keep it that way, so: get up-to-date information from <a href="https://www.who.int/">WHO</a>, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a>, or your <a href="https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory">local Department of Public Health</a>, not your friendly neighborhood truck man.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, I've been getting a lot of questions about how I'm handling the current happenings, so I'll talk a little bit about what I've been up to, and then more generally about tangential topics, like having good routines, stock market crashes, and how I handle sickness. In retrospect, those should probably all be their own posts, oh well.</p>
<h2>It all started&#8230;</h2>
<p>&#8230;a few weeks ago, when my employer instituted a voluntary "work from home" policy. It seemed a bit premature to me at the time: there were only a handful of cases in the <em>entire</em> US, but of course I had never heard of the concept of <a href="https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html">"flattening the curve"</a> and I wasn't aware of the severity of situations in Wuhan or Italy, so it didn't make a ton of sense to me. In any case, I continued to go into work, because working from "home" isn't really something I have a desire to do. I've told my co-workers I live in a place near campus (true), with a few roommates (not true), and have generally described my home as a place I don't like to spend my time (very true). As such, my desire to continue working from the office didn't seem all that unreasonable or suspicious.</p>
<p>Days passed and the situation changed quickly. <em>Voluntary</em> work from home became <em>recommended</em> work from home, which promptly became <strong>strongly recommended</strong> work from home, a recommendation I dutifully continued to ignore. I was one of maybe three people in my office; it was lovely and I got a lot of stuff done. With the transition to <strong>strongly recommended</strong> work from home, the office cafeterias stopped serving breakfast and dinner, which I remedied by biking to my favorite cafes in the morning, making more meal replacement shakes, and leaning a little more heavily on the office kitchen snacks. I ate <em>a lot</em> of Rice Krispies that week.</p>
<p>I had plans to go to Aspen with my girlfriend (who lives in Colorado) and some co-workers. I found out those plans were cancelled&#8230;when I landed in Denver. So instead, I spent a few days ambling around a mid-sized Coloradan city, which wasn't altogether unpleasant. I was scheduled to leave Monday night, but then we got the <a href="https://sf.gov/stay-home-except-essential-needs">Bay Area shelter-in-place order</a>.</p>
<p>In light of the order, my employer strengthened their language to <strong><em>mandatory</em></strong> work from home. To show how Super Serious they were, they also closed down most of the offices. This sounded like a bad time to be living in a truck, so I moved my flight out a few days to assess the situation, and to play house with my girlfriend in her 400 sq ft apartment. After a week of the two of us working from home mere feet apart and me driving her halfway up a wall<sup>kidding<sup>hopefully</sup></sup>, I headed back to the Bay. That was three days ago, so where does that put me now?</p>

</div>
<h2>The Digs</h2>
<p>I'm not going to keep you in suspense: I'm at an Airbnb in Oakland. I had originally planned to try and rough it from the truck, but then I realized the gyms on campus were closed (and all gyms in a 50 mile radius for that matter, I checked). This made things difficult for me. You see, the campus gym is my lifeblood: it's got things to pick up <em>and</em> showers, the sum total of which keeps me sane and mostly smell-free.</p>
<p>Now, when I say the gyms were <em>closed</em>, the buildings were <em>technically</em> still accessible; my work badge still opened them. But all of the following conspired against my conscience to keep me out of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit instructions to not use them</strong> - Now I'm all for living at the margins of rules and laws, it's basically my pastime. But outright ignoring an explicit instruction from my employer, an instruction with the explicit purpose of keeping people safe and healthy, that didn't seem like the right move.</li>
<li><strong>Security roaming around at a much higher frequency</strong> - I'm not trying to make the security folks' lives any harder (by making them deal with me). I also just don't want to have to explain myself.</li>
<li>
<strong>Two fun Covid-19 facts</strong> - When combined, these facts make me a liability to the gym (and vice versa):
  <ol>
<li><a href="https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/asymptomatic-carriers-coronavirus">Healthy people can be asymptomatic carriers of the virus</a> - Meaning I could COVID-up the gym and not even know it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973">It can live on surfaces for 72 hours</a> - Meaning anyone who used the gym three days before me could get me sick, and similarly, I could accidentally get any other rule-breaking gym-goers sick up to three days later.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p>I think I <em>could have</em> made the truck work, but it wouldn't have been particularly fun: the constant eating out or deluge of meal replacement shakes would have been either expensive or extraordinarily boring and I'm not about to break my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-1-no-food/5643440998055936">"No Food in the Truck" Rule</a>. And with the aforementioned gyms being closed, there weren't a whole lot of reasons to stay put, all of the resources I normally have were gone. So I bit the bullet and got an Airbnb. As someone who owns very little and travels a decent amount, this effectively amounted to moving. I loaded up my car with my work and personal computers, a monitor I <del>stole</del> borrowed from work, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-1-of-3-a-bike-/5761673931522048">my bike</a>, a few books, five days worth of clothes, and a yoga mat (we'll discuss that later). All together, it looks something like thing:

<p><strong>Left/Top</strong>: I'd never actually had to disassemble my bike before, I learned a thing or two about the brake assembly and the anti-theft wheel lock system, the unfortunately named <a href="https://www.kryptonitelock.com/en/products/product-information/current-key/001768.html">WheelNutz</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Center:</strong> My new office for the next week. I always keep a water bottle at my desk, gotta stay hydrated in these trying times. Screens feature me working on this post, for maximum meta-ness.</p>
<p><strong>Right/Bottom</strong>: My re-assembled bike and pretty much everything else I own. I borrowed the GameCube controller from the office so my co-workers and I can attempt to play games online together.</p>
</div>
<p>I'll be working from here this week and leaving on Saturday, at which point I'll evaluate the situation and likely get another Airbnb somewhere else, perhaps even farther away. Now, here's a potpourri of tangentially related things that should probably be their own posts.</p>
<h2>Keeping Consistent</h2>
<p><a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-day-in-the-life-weekday-edition/5645478960037888">Routine is very important to me</a>. There's lots of research to show that having a solid routine and building good habits has lots of positive ripple effects through the rest of your life. Obviously, working from home for weeks on end or, like me, packing up everything you own and going elsewhere, will necessitate some routine changes. Here's the new routine that I've carved out for myself, effective tomorrow.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>4:45 - 5:25 am</em> <strong>Wake up.</strong> I'm going to try and keep my existing sleep schedule, though it may be harder to leave my cozy new digs than it usually is.</p>
<p><em>5:30 - 7:30 am (ish)</em> <strong>Bike ride.</strong> I went through quite a bit to drag my bike here, and I intend to use it. In the absence of strength training equipment, long, scenic bike rides seemed like a decent alternative. It's one of the reasons I picked a place so far away. I've already picked and downloaded <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/31586510">my route for Monday morning</a>. From my Airbnb, it's a ~30 mile jaunt around the shorelines of Oakland and Alameda. Since the ride coincides with sunrise, I'm expecting it to be quite pretty.</p>
<p><em>7:30 - 8:00 am</em> <strong>Breakfast.</strong> For the first time in a long time, I went grocery shopping for myself. I'm going to attempt to prepare meals without injuring myself or the kitchen.</p>
<p><em>8:00 am - 4:00 pm</em> <strong>Work.</strong> Tippy-tapping on keyboards, Important Business Meetings&#8482;, all the standard fare, but with more video calling and "I think your microphone is muted" than usual. Food will also be cooked and consumed in this interval.</p>
<p><em>4:00 - 5:00 pm</em> <strong>Yoga.</strong> I wanted a clear signal to myself that says "you are now done doing work for the day", and I figured an hour of chill yoga would serve that purpose nicely. It's especially important to me now that my "doing work" and "personal shenanigans" computer areas are the same place. I've done yoga on and off for years, I think it's great for mental health and, for me personally, flexibility, which is key for not injuring yourself when strength training. I lost a bet with a friend a while ago, the net result being that I eventually had to write a post about doing yoga in the truck (titled <em>Troga</em>&#8230;eesh). I came very near to doing Troga on Saturday when the gym was closed, but thought better of it and went for a walk instead. This is likely as close as I'll ever get to writing that post.</p>
<p><em>5:00 - 9:00 pm</em> <strong>Assorted debauchery.</strong> Errands, books, games, blog posts, and projects.<sup>oh my!</sup></p>
<p><em>9:00 pm - 5:00 am</em> <strong>Sleep.</strong> Rinse and repeat.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I don't expect to stick to that routine <em>exactly</em>, but I'm going to use it as a strong guideline. Without the normal structure of work, it's easy to either work way too much or way too little, so some gentle bumpers will help here.</p>
<h2>Stocks, Stocks, Stocks</h2>
<p>I've been told that the global economic system is presently in free fall. In all likelihood, I've lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in monopoly money. Since I'm not retiring for at least the next few years, this doesn't really matter to me. I'm going to continue to do what I've done for the past five years: buy more stock at every opportunity I get.</p>
<p>In fact, stock is on sale right now, so I'm going to get more than usual, which sounds pretty good to me. If you aren't planning on retiring in the near future, you probably shouldn't be panic-selling all your stock, especially if it's in a 401k or similar fund that penalizes early withdrawals.</p>
<p class="text-center">That's a Generally Bad Idea&#8482;.</p>
<h2>In Sickness</h2>
<p>A while ago, in a <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/qa-7-uniformly-unrelated/5635415851663360">Q&amp;A post</a>, I got a question about what I'd do if I got a "debilitating case of viral gastroenteritis", which in retrospect is suspiciously specific. Anyway, I answered thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
My primary plan is to rely on my good health, nutrition, exercise, and sleep schedule to prevent debilitating cases of viral gastroenteritis in the first place. But if I were to find myself involuntarily returning the contents of my stomach with regular frequency, I'd probably take off work and grab a hotel room for a few days to sleep it off. Luckily, I get sick pretty infrequently and haven't had to resort to the suite life just yet. Fingers crossed.
</blockquote>
<p>And that's pretty much my all-around "getting sick" strategy: hunker down somewhere and ride it out. I'm fortunate in that I rarely get sick (less than once a year), and when I <em>do</em> get sick, it's usually over in a day, and not completely miserable at that. We'll see what COVID-19 has in store.</p>

<em>Source: <span>I couldn't really think of a good title picture for this post. I didn't want to take a picture of the condensation, because that's gross. You could view this one two ways: the bucket is either supposed to be a desiccant full of the water it sucked up, or it's nature dumping water all over the truck.</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Continuing <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/truckquakes/5635566435565568">my new trend</a> of discussing Californian curiosities,* let's talk about water. Speaking with only the slightest bit of hyperbole, it doesn't rain in the Bay Area from May through September, but it gets decently damp from October onward. And I'm not just talking about rain; some mornings bring with them a <strong>thick</strong> layer of condensation, which <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/mini-home-improvement-project-2-desiccants/5707274949492736">I've addressed before</a>, a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>Back then, I thought the condensation was, in large part, just me breathing in the box<sup>a lot</sup>, which seems kinda silly (and gross) in retrospect. I've since learned exhalation only accounts for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22714078">a small amount of it</a>: <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/h2o3.htm">less than a cup per night</a>. The majority just condenses out of the air. Normal folks call this 'humidity', but apparently the word escaped me when I wrote that last post.</p>
<p>One thing that continues to perplex me though is how physics decides which surfaces get covered in condensation. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew">Wikipedia article on Dew</a>, which is riveting stuff, explains it as:</p>
<blockquote>
[Dew] forms most easily on surfaces that are not warmed by conducted heat from deep ground, such as grass, leaves, railings, car roofs, and bridges
</blockquote>
<p>&#8230;which seems pretty straightforward, but my experience has still been kinda confusing. Here's a brief, informal survey of the various damp and dry surfaces of my truck.</p>
<h3>Occasionally Damp Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>Soft fuzzy blanket</li>
<li>Metal ceiling</li>
<li>Glass sunroof</li>
</ul>
<h3>Generally Dry Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>Other blanket/comforter</li>
<li>Metal storage cabinet</li>
<li>EPS foam insulation</li>
</ul>
<p>I vaguely understand it has to do with heat conduction, but, for example, I'd expect the storage cabinet and the roof to conduct heat similarly, both being metal. And yet, on especially moist mornings, the cabinet will be bone dry even when there are literal droplets condensing and falling from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Writing that out, it sounds kinda bad, things being damp and drippy and all. You'd think everything would get moldy and gross and generally problematic, but in the nearly five years I've been doing this, it's been totally fine (well, now that <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/rain-rain-go-away/5760820306771968">the leaks</a> are fixed). I think that's in large part due to the ventilation provided by the sunroof, me occasionally toweling down the offending surfaces, and, of course, my liberal use of desiccants.</p>
<p>I've faithfully made the trek to Home Depot every October like a weird, damp pilgrimage, purchasing that mystical cat litter in an increasing variety of form factors. I've got the standard tub under the bed, hanging ones for my clothes rack, and little boxy ones for inside my storage cabinet. The desiccants are definitely doing <em>something</em>, because after a rainy season, they're all full of water that they've pulled out of the truck.</p>
<h2>The Splash</h2>
<p>One other weird winter weather phenomenon I've encountered is, for reasons I might never truly understand, a deluge of water will just pour through the sunroof. It has happened four or five times, and <em>only</em> ever in the middle of the night.  I'll be sleeping, and then I'll hear a sound akin to a lot of water hitting the floor, loud enough to wake me up. I get up and sure enough, there's a lot of water on the floor, probably a few cups worth. I usually towel it off, barely conscious and acting purely mechanically, then hop back into bed.</p>
<p>Because of the ungodly hour this happens, my memories are hazy and incomplete. The sunroof is always open, but I don't <em>think</em> it's ever raining, because I try not to open it on nights there's a chance of rain. Plus, rain in the truck is loud and memorable. My best guess is that the open sunroof is good at collecting moisture, which then drops onto the <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-project-7-let-there-be-light-and-heat-and-stuff/5694639155707904">fine mesh</a> I use to keep out leaves and bugs. Once there's a critical mass of water, surface tension (or something?) breaks and the puddle quickly filters through the net and to the ground.</p>
<p>It's either that, or someone is standing on the roof and pouring water into the truck to mess with me. <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/strange-times-in-truck-town/5756035713204224">It's more likely than you might think.</a></p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><em>Truckquake</em> is the poor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> (poortmanteau?) I'm going to use to describe earthquakes that I experience when I'm in the truck.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are a relatively common phenomenon in California. According to  the <a href="https://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/Pages/Earthquakes/earthquake-faq.aspx">California Department of Conservation</a>, there are ~200 "potentially hazardous" <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=fault">faults</a> in the state, and they generate an average of "two or three" quakes per year registering 5.5 or higher on the Richter scale, which is enough to cause "moderate [structural] damage". Fun, lighthearted stuff.</p>
<p>With earthquakes being common and all, earthquake <em>stories</em> similarly abound: A friend who awoke in the dead of night to their bed swaying; pets howling in confusion. A coworker who was driving when&#8212;suddenly&#8212;their car takes on a life of its own, veering this way and that, with the rest of traffic following suit. A neighbor who just <em>swears</em> there was a little one last night, even if nobody else felt it.</p>
<p class="text-center">I'm now going to regale you with my own <em>truckquake</em> tale.</p>
<p>They always happen at night, because that's the <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-day-in-the-life-weekday-edition/5645478960037888">only time</a> I'm in the truck. I'm awakened by a sensation like someone shaking the truck back and forth. My first thought: "Is someone jumping on the tailgate?", which isn't as ridiculous a question as it should be, given that it's actually happened to me a few times. But we'll save those stories for another time.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the sensation: it's akin to being in a car that a group of rabid frat bros are trying to flip over, conceivably because their sports team of choice has lost. Except it's much gentler&#8212;think <em>small</em> frat bros. Or maybe it's more like the sensation when another car passes yours at close range and your car kind of <em>shudders</em> in the wake, but on loop.</p>
<p>I'm realizing these descriptions don't sound nice, but the experience isn't altogether unpleasant. In fact, the quake normally rocks me back to sleep as quickly as it woke me, the whole experience being over within 45 seconds or so. One time, I vaguely remember thinking I was being abducted by aliens, which meant I had weirder than usual dreams for the rest of the night. But most of the time, I don't even recognize what happened until the next morning, when I have more of my faculties about me (or a co-worker mentions the quake).</p>
<h2>Uhh&#8230;is any of that safe?</h2>
<p>I've always been curious about how I'd fare during a truly terrible earthquake like, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#The_next_.22Big_One.22">the Big One</a>. Specifically, am I better or worse off in the truck than an actual, honest-to-God building? I figured my biggest concern was the whole truck entering freefall as the ground disappears below it, but after doing the slightest bit of research*, <a href="https://www.lamag.com/driver/caught-in-the-quake-what-to-do-if-you-are-driving-when-an-earthquake-strikes/">Los Angeles Magazine</a> set me straight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What if&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><em>&#8230;The earth opens up and swallows me whole?</em> Luckily, these kinds of earthquakes only happen in cartoons and the Bible. What you&#8217;re probably thinking of is a sinkhole, which is caused by underground erosion, not by an earthquake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I guess I have nothing to worry about on that front.</p>
<p>More realistically, my main adversary would be trees falling on the truck. But, for no reason in particular, my bed is on the driver's side of the truck, which means it's closer to the road. That's awfully convenient, because if there are any nearby trees, they'd likely be on the passenger side. And hopefully, as they ripped viciously through the truck in a din of rending metal, some part of the frame would slow them down (and ideally stop them) before they reached my vulnerable, slumbering body, like a scene in a <em>Final Destination</em> movie.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/driving-earthquake/">All</a> <a href="https://www.progressive.com/lifelanes/on-the-road/earthquake-safety/">of</a> <a href="https://www.earthquakecountry.org/step5/">the</a> <a href="https://www.allstate.com/resources/allstate/attachments/tools-and-resources/pz-motorists-guide-earthquake-safety-apr-2015.pdf">other</a> "Driving in an Earthquake" resources I looked at just suggest pulling over and waiting it out. So if I'm fast asleep in the back, it seems like I'm already doing the best I can do. Plus, it seems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_spring">suspension</a> on the truck smooths out the ebbs and flows of the quake, so I should just sit back, relax, and enjoy the <del>show</del> throe.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I literally just Googled "earthquake in a car", which isn't even a good way to phrase what I was looking for.</em></p>

<p class="text-center"><em>Oh Christmastime, what can I say about you that hasn't already been said?</em></p>
<p class="text-center">Literally nothing, so let's just skip the whole "waxing poetic about Christmas" business.</p>
<p>My personal relationship with Christmas is, well, <em>slightly</em> complicated and <em>always</em> changing. I was raised Jewish (as I've <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/leaner-and-greener-2-lean-2-green/5753952654065664">mentioned</a> <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/homeostatsis/5668387241852928">before</a>), but I fell off the Judaism-bandwagon pretty much immediately after my Bar Mitzvah. Not to say that my family were particularly good Jews to begin with &#8212; we <em>faithfully</em> celebrated Christmas every year, and <em>occasionally</em> lit our Menorah candles and said our blessings.* But with the advent of my truckliness, my thoughts on Christmas, and specifically, on giving and receiving gifts, have changed pretty handily.</p>
<p>As a kid, I <em>loved</em> Christmas. I loved waking up at an ungodly hour each Christmas morning (much to the chagrin of my half-asleep parents) to see what Santa** had dutifully left behind. My Swiss cheese brain hasn't retained many memories from my childhood, but I do vividly remember seeing that new boombox or Playstation 2, then sitting around and drinking hot cocoa while I set it all up.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I live 3,000 miles away from most of the people I celebrate Christmas with, which has changed the Rules of Gift Engagement&#8482; quite a bit.</p>
<h2>The Rules of Gift Engagement</h2>
<p>Over the past five Christmases, I've learned little tips and tricks for navigating the holidays with my hometown family and friends, and adjusted my gifting policies accordingly.</p>
<h3>Gift Giving</h3>
<p>My gift <em>giving</em> policy is simple: I'll give people whatever they damn well want, with a gentle preference for things that are practical and hopefully not too self-destructive. Obviously the amount I spend on a gift correlates with how much I like the person, or at least how much I'd like them not to be mad at me. I'll usually have all the gifts delivered directly to Boston well ahead of time, where they'll stay under the watchful eye of my sister until the time arrives.</p>
<p>For family, my gift giving strategy is to asking them what they want/need, and then I'll just get that. If they say "don't get me anything", you can bet I'm not getting them anything. For my friends, at least for the past decade or so, I've rounded them all up in a room lousy with alcohol and made them compete in a variety of online mini-games for cash, prizes, fame, and <del>intoxication</del> glory. As I've mentioned before, past years' festivities have included online twists on <a href="https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Card Against Humanity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em">Texas Hold 'Em</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman">Bomberman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a>, and <a href="https://bananagrams.com/">Bananagrams</a>, which I usually begin working on each August or September.</p>
<h3>Gift Receiving</h3>
<p>My gift <em>receiving</em> policy is even simpler. If I had to sum it up in a picture, it'd look something like:</p>
<div class="inline-image">

<p>Image stolen with love from <a href="https://screenrant.com/grinch-stole-christmas-movie-jim-carrey-behind-scenes/">Screen Rant</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>I'm a total Grinch when it comes to Christmas, and I can oft be heard repeating my favorite Christmastime mantra, "I don't want any gifts, don't give me anything." You would think this would be an easy request. After all, what's easier than doing nothing? But alas, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X">giving gifts is how some people show their affection</a>, so I've really had to put my foot down in recent years. I've come up with a whole list*** of bulletproof reasons why you shouldn't get me a gift:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I can't bring it on the plane</strong> - This is my go-to excuse. It's short, it's practical, and it doesn't require a discussion about trucks or my own personal beliefs around conspicuous consumption. Are you really going to give me a five-foot-tall stuffed animal knowing full well I'm going to have to shove it into the non-existent space under my Basic Economy seat on my overbooked flight back to San Francisco?</li>
<li><strong>I don't have room for it</strong> - I have roughly 128 ft<sup>2</sup> of living space. Shockingly, most of it is open and unused, but that's <em>because</em> I'm a curmudgeon-y stickler about things like this. As an added bonus, mentioning the square footage of my abode doesn't necessitate mentioning the truck; people can be left to speculate about whatever squalid and cramped Bay Area housing conditions I must live in to have turned down their well intentioned Game of Thrones chess board.</li>
<li><strong>I literally don't have electricity</strong> - This is my go-to excuse for smaller gifts, where I can't hide behind my travel or living space constraints. If it has batteries or requires an outlet, it's a logistically difficult gift for me to work with. Sure, I could charge it or use it at work, but I'm not going to plug an Instant Pot in at my work desk, Aunt Karen.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the above excuses work well because they also don't shift the blame to the gift-giver, who, after all, is just trying to do a nice thing and spread some holiday cheer. These excuses are simply explanations for my own personal failings. But if someone still insists on getting me a gift after the above explanations ("<em>oh it'll just be something small</em>", "<em>trust me, you'll love it</em>", etc, etc), I bring out the big guns:</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>I don't need anything.</strong></p>
<p>I usually accompany this claim with some variant of the following rant.</p>
<h2>The Rant</h2>
<p>I've got <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-art-of-not-buying-things/5718532058775552">a pretty neatly-defined process</a> for introducing new <em>things</em> into my life. It works well for me: I've figured out the bare minimum I <strong>need</strong> to get by (with appropriately comfort-zone-expanding levels of discomfort), plus the set of creature comforts I <strong>want</strong> (usually in pursuit of my few varied hobbies). It is having that exact combination of things that makes me very, very happy.</p>
<p>Short of funds to build a house and start my early retirement now, I have everything I want or need. If I truly need something, I buy it, plain and simple. I don't write a list or wait for a holiday, I just go and get it. And if I don't need it, I very likely don't want it. Following this to its (il)logical conclusion: come Christmas, I've internalized a steadfast belief that any physical gift will only make my life <em>worse</em>, by taking up space or going to waste or getting in the way or something <em>grumble grumble</em>. Like I said, very Grinch-like.</p>
<p>It's a pretty dramatic departure from childhood Brandon and his foaming at the mouth over the mere suggestion of a new iPod, but my ideas around happiness have changed in the intervening decade or two. Plus, I'm rich now, at least by every possible definition except the most American of them. This excerpt from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Altruism/dp/1592409660"><em>Doing Good Better</em></a> sums it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
If you earn more than $52,000 per year, then, speaking globally, you are the 1 percent. If you earn at least $28,000&#8212;that's the typical income for working individuals in the United States&#8212;you're in the richest 5 percent of the world's population. Even someone living below the US poverty line, earning just $11,000 per year, is still richer than 85 percent of the people in the world.
</blockquote>
<p>If you're reading this blog, a blog chiefly about living cheaply in Silicon Valley, you likely fall into that richest 15% category, if not the 1%. But anyway, that relative richness means that, if I pare down my wants and needs a bit, I can easily have everything I desire to desire, with plenty to spare.</p>
<p>But I'm getting a bit sidetracked, so let's turn the discussion back to gifts and the transfer thereof: what if someone <em>still</em> insists on getting you a gift even after your anti-consumption tirade ruins a perfectly decent Thanksgiving dinner? Or maybe you're on the opposite end: what do you get for the Brandons in your own life without offending their radical sensibilities? I'm glad you asked, here are some ideas, plucked primarily from suggestions I've given my own well-meaning mother:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Donation to a charity</strong> - This one works well because everyone gets to feel warm and fuzzy. Personally, I'll also offer up a list of suggestions, usually plucked straight from <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Tickets to an event</strong> - Events are great because you don't have to own them for the rest of your life. It's one and done. The recipient might even enjoy it. Personally, I don't even care what the event is&#8212;I'm always looking to expand my horizons. You got me tickets to Hungarian throat singing in San Francisco? Hell yeah! I'm about to experience something novel and exciting, and I might even get to drag one of my beleaguered friends along for a unique night out.</li>
<li><strong>Passes to some other sort of experience</strong> - Give someone a <a href="https://www.groupon.com/">Groupon</a> to cooking or dancing or knife-juggling lessons near them. Or maybe a massage/spa day pass. Or maybe an escape room. Sky's the limit (except in the case of skydiving, which is also an option). Personally, I'll try <del>anything</del> most things at least once (but sometimes <em>exactly</em> once, looking at you Gilroy Garlic Festival).</li>
<li><strong>Cash &amp; Gift Cards</strong> - The more generic, the better. Let the recipient decide what, if anything, they want or need. Personally, If you hand me some cash, I'm more than happy to donate it myself, or treat myself to a few shares of <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX">VTSAX</a>. Worried I'll spend it on drugs? Give me an Amazon gift card and I'll pick up a few eBooks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Christmas <del><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790621/">Kiss</a></del> Miracle</h2>
<p>I'm happy to report that this Christmas, for the first time ever, nobody got me any <em>things</em>. It's been a long road to get here, full of ill-fitting clothes and awkward gift rejections, but we made it. This year, I got a donation in my name, some cash, a few scratch tickets, a handful of protein bars (which I ate well before I left), and I was treated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas_(musical)">a play</a>. I know it took a Herculean feat of restraint for certain members of my family (looking at you Mom), so I took pains to express just how much it meant to me. With gifts not taking center-stage, it was that much easier to enjoy some quality time with those I hold most dear.</p>
<p class="text-center">Happy (belated) Holidays!</p>
<p>*<em class="small">Let the record show that my mother gave up on trying to find the Menorah this year after approximately 30 seconds of searching for it.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">There was no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah_Harry">Hanukkah Harry</a> in our household, and I had my suspicions about who Santa actually was, but I can't recall when he stopped being the mastermind behind my yearly One Big Christmas Gift&#8482;.</em></p>
<p>***<em class="small">Just to be clear, any and all gifts and relatives mentioned in this list are purely hypothetical. I've never been gifted a giant teddy bear, Game of Thrones chess set (though I'm sure it exists), or Instant Pot. I also don't have an Aunt Karen.</em></p>

<p>I want to travel more. It's a <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Travel">well-documented</a> desire of mine. Specifically, I want to plan my own trips, because I've historically been pretty terrible at it. I even made a <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/going-solo/5741642204053504">"process"</a>, which I'll paraphrase here:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Wait until a particularly whimsical mood strikes.</li>
<li>Bike aimlessly until you find a book store.</li>
<li>Enter the book store.</li>
<li>Find the travel/travel guide section.</li>
<li>Close your eyes.</li>
<li>Spin around, preferably 3-5 times.</li>
<li>With eyes still closed, pick a travel guide off the shelf.</li>
<li>Buy the travel guide.</li>
<li>Read the travel guide.</li>
<li>Go there. Optional: Be merry.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Using this bulletproof approach, I had picked out a destination, Taiwan. I don't want to say I'm giving up on all of that, because I'm definitely still going to do it&#8230;I just went somewhere else first. To explain <em>where</em> and <em>why</em> requires the slightest bit of backstory.</p>
<h2>Oregon (aka The Slightest Bit of Backstory)</h2>
<p>In 2017, I saw my first total solar eclipse in Oregon, and it left quite an impression on me. The sky darkened over the course of a few minutes, taking on a weird, twilight-esque hue. The temperature dropped by 10 or 15 degrees. Birds started acting strangely. Suddenly, it was <em>very</em> dark, the sky ringed with light on the horizon. I looked directly at the sun (normally an ill-advised thing to do), my eyes meeting a black orb surrounded with the wispy, shifting tendrils of the Sun's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona">corona</a>. I can understand why ancient civilizations believed in some truly crazy gods. Needless to say, I was hooked.</p>
<p>The main barrier to my newfound addiction: total solar eclipses are finicky. They don't happen often (~less than once a year), and they happen over an effectively random stretch of the planet. Post-2017, the next one wasn't until 2019, and it had every intention of passing over a narrow strip of South America, visible in small parts of Chile and Argentina. Even more rudely, this narrow strip (in dark red below, call the "path of totality") had the audacity to avoid most of the major cities that would make viewing it easy.</p>

<p>That said, I wasn't going to let the machinations of a few stubborn celestial bodies rain on my parade. So, a few months ago, I traveled 6,000 miles for an event that lasts approximately, you guessed it, 2 minutes and 17 seconds.</p>
<h2>Chile</h2>
<p>Chile Chile Chile, where do I begin. It all started about a week before I took off&#8230;</p>
<h3>Preparations (Or a Lack Thereof)</h3>
<p>&#8230;because that's when I actually planned (and subsequently booked) the trip. I recognize that this was Not Smart of Me&#8482; for no less than 13 different reasons. While I won't enumerate all of them, let's take a peek at a few here.</p>
<h5><del>13</del> 4 Reasons Why Booking My First Solo, Non-Work International Trip One Week Prior to Departure Was a Bad Move&#8482;</h5>
<ol>
<li>Stuff gets expensive.</li>
<li>One week isn't a lot of time to plan.</li>
<li>I've made this mistake for every trip I've done in the past.</li>
<li>I knew I was going to do the trip a year and a half in advance.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've gotten into this bad habit of not really planning my trips, because they're usually for work. That means most of the blanks are already filled in for me: dates of travel, places to stay, itinerary, etc. None of that was true here, and I wasn't really setting myself up for success by not budgeting the time for it.</p>
<p>In spite of my best efforts however, I still managed to pull the trip together. I had <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-credit-card-churning-4147321">churned</a> through enough credit cards to pay for the round trip flight, even accounting for how inflated the prices had become. And I used my solitary week before departure to figure out the absolute basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visa requirements (None)</li>
<li>National Language (Chilean Spanish, among others)</li>
<li>Season &amp; Climate (Winter at the time, but not in the bitter New England sense)</li>
<li>Risk of danger? (Not particularly)</li>
</ul>
<p>After one week of frantic and frenzied Googling, I had all my flights and accommodations and odds-and-ends booked, and a plan that looked roughly like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get near the eclipse (San Francisco -&gt; New York -&gt; Santiago -&gt; La Serena)</li>
<li>Stay in an Airbnb in La Serena</li>
<li>Watch the eclipse</li>
<li>Take a bus to Santiago</li>
<li>Stay in a hostel in Santiago</li>
<li>Explore Santiago</li>
<li>Get home (Santiago -&gt; New York -&gt; San Francisco)</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-center">
<em class="small">
Okay, I swear I won't make another list or trademark Another Random Phrase&#8482; for the rest of the post.
</em>
</p>
<p>A pretty basic plan, I'll admit, but it covered all the bases. I'd fly to near the eclipse (three flights), get used to the area, see the eclipse, take a bus to Chile's capital/largest city, stay in a hostel, (perhaps) meet some people, explore the city, and fly home from there (two flights).</p>
<h3>The Arrival</h3>
<p>My first couple days were fraught with all the hurdles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy's Law</a> could cook up. Flights were delayed, phones weren't working, and for a brief, suspenseful, and utterly nerve-wracking moment, I truly believed my Airbnb didn't actually exist. Once everything was all sorted out and I got settled in, the adventures began.</p>
<p>My first order of business was getting some food. La Serena (the largest Chilean city where the eclipse was visible from) is fairly small as far as cities go, and not particularly known for its food. Accordingly, I opted to pick up groceries so I could cook for myself. The reason for this was two-fold: 1) it's a good way to save a few bucks while travelling, and 2) I never get to cook for myself, the truck being devoid of appliances&#8230;and electricity&#8230;<a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-1-no-food/5643440998055936">and food</a>.</p>
<p>I took a bus to the local Lider (a chain acquired by Walmart) and marveled at all the little differences and things entirely lost on me in my day-to-day life. Milk was in un-refrigerated boxes, as were eggs. Jelly came in little bags. You weigh your fruits and vegetables where you get them, not at the register. This last one got me good, it took a fraught game of charades for the cashier to explain the concept to me at checkout.</p>
<p>My second order of business was getting <em>really</em> familiar with the buses and the schedule. Because I booked so late, all the hotels in La Serena were booked and I ended up in Coquimbo, ~10 miles from La Serena. I wanted to make sure I didn't miss the eclipse because of my own ineptitude at catching the bus.</p>

<p>Looking out from my Airbnb in Coquimbo. Off in the distance, just barely visible, is Coquimbo's main attraction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruz_del_Tercer_Milenio">Cruz del Tercer Milenio</a>, which is a ~270ft concrete cross.</p>
</div>
<h3>Settling In</h3>
<p>After a few days of learning the ropes, I had a couple basic takeaways:</p>
<p>1) My single, meager year of high school Spanish was no match for literally any conversation I attempted to navigate. Chileans speak far too quickly for my untrained ears, and the Chilean accent kinda drops the trailing sound off a work (like in French), which means things just sound different. Two of my most commonly used phrases (in Spanish) were "More slowly, please" and simply "What?". Hand gestures abounded.</p>
<p>2) Chilean money is infinitely entertaining. A bunch of bananas cost $616, because Chilean pesos use the same dollar sign ($) used for US currency. Technically they do have cents (centavos), but in practice, I didn't see any coins for less than 10 pesos.</p>
<p>3) Chilean buses are <strong>wild</strong>. I drove buses for four years in college, so I like to think I know a thing or two about them. Chilean bus drivers are on a whole 'nother level, and clearly competing in some bus rodeo that I'm not privy to. They <em>whip</em> those buses around like it's nobody's business. At one point, the bus I was on hopped a median because it didn't want to wait in traffic. My terror was matched only by my admiration.</p>
<h3>El Eclipse Solar Total</h3>
<div class="inline-image">

<p>Perfect eclipse-watching weather.</p>
</div>
<p>The day of the eclipse (July 2nd) rolls around, and I'm ready for action. I get to La Serena with plenty of time to spare. My lack of planning (see above) meant that I had forgotten one crucial tool: eclipse glasses. No problem though, everyone and their grandpa is selling cardboard eclipse glasses downtown, at a 10x markup. I fork over the cash and continue onward. Such is life.</p>
<p>Walking around with my eclipse glasses in hand, freshly divorced from ten US dollars, I decide I want to watch the event in relative quiet. There's a big eclipse festival going on downtown, so I start to head away towards a quieter residential area. The city slope downward from downtown to the coast, which means there are plenty of uninterrupted views of the sun. I walk a few miles, then sit down on a stone ledge alongside the sidewalk. And I wait.</p>
<p>I lied (multiple times) when I said that the eclipse only lasts two minutes and seventeen seconds. In actuality, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/chile/la-serena?iso=20190702">the eclipse was nearly two and a half hours</a>. It's just <em>totality</em>, the part people travel to see, where everything gets dark, that's so fleeting. When I sat down, the partial eclipse was just starting, so I had nearly an hour until the main event.</p>
<p>So there I was, sitting alone on my stone ledge, staring at the sun, paper glasses on my face, when an older lady strolls by pushing a small folding cart, clearly puzzled as to what I'm doing. I've since forgotten the smaller details of our interaction (such as her name), but she was Mormon, and had lived in La Serena her whole life. She was delighted to hear I came from California: her Mormon friend, who she kept an old picture of in her purse, lived there too.</p>
<p>We conversed mostly in Spanish, with <em>very</em> heavy use of a notepad that she would write down words in, and I would translate on my phone. She was infinitely patient. We spoke of the eclipse, the current goings-on in Chile and the US, the weather, and of family and religion. She initially tried to watch the eclipse by putting her flip phone's screen to her eye with the camera app open, which was an ultimately unsuccessful approach. We sat on the ledge for two hours, passing the glasses back and forth to watch the progress of the partial eclipse, sometimes in total silence, sometimes just pointing in delight at the progress the moon was making in its journey towards totality.</p>
<p>She had never seen a total solar eclipse before. In fact, she hadn't even realized one was going to happen then and there. To this day, I'm not sure what I enjoyed more: the eclipse itself, or the look on her face when it finally happened. She was so completely in awe and overjoyed, it was truly a special moment, and I couldn't have asked for (or planned) a better eclipse experience if I had tried.</p>
<p>Eventually, totality passed. My new Chilean friend and I parted ways, the brief intersection in our otherwise disjoint lives now over. I bused back (in obscene traffic) to my Airbnb, reflected a little on the experience, and packed my things for Santiago.</p>
<h3>Santiago</h3>
<p>My bus to Santiago was scheduled to leave at 10 am. Out of an abundance of caution (and partially by accident), I ended up at the terminal at 8 am. With plenty of time to spare, I ordered a coffee, opened <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E84BABW">a book</a>, and partook in my favorite pastime: people watching. Transit hubs are great for people watching, because they're frequently where people are beginning (and ending) different chapters of their lives, and they're full of people from diverse backgrounds.* It makes it easy to come up with grand backstories.</p>
<p>The six and a half hour bus ride was mostly uneventful. My seat was in the front row of the second-floor of a double-decker bus, which afforded me some pretty incredible views as we barreled down the Chilean coast. The TVs were playing clearly pirated rips of some straight-to-DVD movies, featuring such blockbusters as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christmas_Chronicles">The Christmas Chronicles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucifixion_(film)">The Crucifixion</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, we arrived in Santiago, and suffice it to say, I was unprepared. I had been disarmed by my few days in the quaint, laid-back La Serena. As it turns out, Santiago is a bustling metropolitan area, with a population larger than Los Angeles. When I got off the bus, I was wholly overwhelmed. It was loud, crowded, dirty, and I was legitimately thinking of shortening my trip by a few days and just heading home. Then I realized that every bus terminal in every major city in the world is loud and crowded and dirty, and it wasn't particularly representative of the rest of the city.</p>
<p>I eventually got my act together, purchased a bus card (<a href="https://santiagochile.com/bip-card/">bip!</a>), and bused to my hostel. I started researching what there was to do in Santiago, and quickly realized Santiago was basically made for me. It's walkable, and chock full of sprawling public parks, high-quality (and frequently free) museums, cute little coffee shops, and even nearby hiking opportunities. I totally could have spent a month there and barely scratched the surface. After an hour or two of researching, I cooked up the following rough itinerary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thursday, July 4th
<ul>
<li>Plaza de Armas</li>
<li>Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino</li>
<li>Museo Historico Nacional</li>
<li>Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral</li>
<li>ProntoMatic<sup>which is a laundromat, because I ran out of clothes.</sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Friday, July 5th
<ul>
<li>Hiking at Cerro San Cristobal</li>
<li>La Chascona</li>
<li>El Hombre Ara&#241;a: Lejos de Casa</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Saturday, July 6th
<ul>
<li>Parque Forestal</li>
<li>Bellas Artes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not going to tackle each item one by one, because this post is already criminally long. So here are some pictures I took with my standard potato-quality smartphone camera:</p>

</div>
<p>Those three days were an absolute blur: I spent a dozen (or more) hours exploring museums and churches, learning a bit about Chile's history (both before and after Europe came knockin'). I checked out book stores and coffee shops and caught a movie and, at one harrowing point, got lost on my hike and stumbled onto someone's haphazard settlement in the woods. They were <strong>not</strong> happy to see me. Safely back down the mountain, I reached a serious milestone when I successfully ordered an empanada (<em>sin carne</em>), and was then able to pay without having to look at the register display (dos mil dos ciento = $2.200 CLP = ~$3 USD). I made some Brazilian friends at the hostel and we went out for dinner/drinks/dancing. The night included <em>several</em> glasses of a Chilean drink called <em>Terremoto</em>, which literally means "earthquake". It's some unholy concoction of alcohol and pineapple ice cream, and I look forward to never drinking another one again.</p>
<p>When I started planning the trip, it was originally "the Eclipse trip". After my whirlwind tour of Santiago, it's now "the Chile trip". I had dramatically underestimated Santiago as a destination unto itself, but I'm happy to report that it proved me wrong (over and over) in the best way.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Now that I've got my first solo (non-work) trip under my belt, I'd like to refine my travel philosophy a bit. In no particular order:</p>
<p><strong>Doing the mundane things is just as important as doing the attractions.</strong> Shopping for groceries at Lider, doing laundry at the local ProntoMatic, or struggling through ordering an empanada, it's all part of the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Pictures aren't a bad thing.</strong> I've always shied away from taking photos when I travel (or go to events). In the past, my rationale has been that I want to be present and live in the moment and all that other romanticized garbage. I'm also just cognizant (read: self-conscious) of looking "too touristy" when I pull out my phone and stand awkwardly in the middle of a crowded place to snap a pic. But photos can be useful. For one, they keep my blog posts from being uninterrupted black-and-white-wall-of-text tirades, adding a bit of color and space. And for two, my memory is total garbage. It doesn't matter how "present" or "in the moment" I am if I forget everything a few days later. Pictures last much longer,** and they'll help me remember when my mind fails me.</p>
<p><strong>Learn the damn language.</strong> I eked by with my limited Spanish, but I could have had a bunch of more meaningful interactions (and been less reliant on my phone) if I had studied up beforehand. I'm certainly not saying I should be fluent, but ~a month of practicing the basics for nights and weekends would have gone a long way.</p>
<p><strong>Don't book first, ask questions later.</strong> I had a great trip, don't get me wrong, but I could have made it even better by planning things out. If I had booked farther in advance, I could have coordinated a hike through the Elqui Valley and sampled local pisco brandy and watched the eclipse from a remote hilltop. But then again, I had a pretty great eclipse experience as it was. I'm still all for spontaneity, but it doesn't work well for events that attract a lot of people.</p>
<h2>Obligatory Housekeeping Item</h2>
<p>The small-to-mid-sized elephant in the room is just <em>how long</em> it's been since I've last written. I actually started this post while I was still in Chile, over five months ago. My defense: I've been busy. In the interim, I've been to Shanghai (twice***), Chicago, Boston, Orlando, and Boulder, and in the next few weeks I'll be in Boulder (again), Boston (again), Chicago (again), Malawi, and Kenya. I've spent my free time <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go111/go-differences">updating the blog infrastructure</a>, reading my usual cocktail of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">self</a>-<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D23CFGR">help</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD46PQZ">sci</a>-<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071X3ZWDN">fi</a>, and getting side-tracked building <a href="https://iscaliforniaburning.com">low-quality novelty sites</a>.</p>
<p>That said, and armed with a new arsenal of organizational techniques, I plan to write more frequently and clear through my backlog of blog email. Well, maybe when I get back from Africa.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">After all, the need to travel from point A to point B cuts across all demographics. Certainly more interesting for people watching than your average yoga studio.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">Barring bad personal data hygiene, of course.</em></p>
<p>***<em class="small">Technically, my first trip to Shanghai was right before I went to Chile, but let's not get stuck on the specifics.</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p class="text-center">This is a story about my poor life choices and where they sometimes take  me. It all started <del>when I was a little boy</del> a few months ago. It's President's day weekend*, and I've got some <em>grand</em> plans, at least in relation to how quiet I usually like my weekends.</p>
<p><strong>Friday </strong>night was catching up with some friends</p>
<p><strong>Saturday </strong>was a holiday party (&#191;in February?)</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong> was exploring San Jose</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> was <em>supposed to be</em> snowboarding, since I'm fortunate enough to have had work off (thank you Mr. Washington)</p>
<p class="text-center">We made it until about Sunday evening before things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pear-shaped#Failure">went pear-shaped</a>.</p>
<h2>Setting The Scene</h2>
<h3>Saturday</h3>
<p>It's Saturday evening, about 6:45 PM. I've quite successfully <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a> myself, having spent the last 6 hours travelling down an infinite rabbit hole of configuring my servers.** I get dragged back to reality by my friend, who's texting me to say she's ready for the holiday party. Now, strictly speaking, I'm not <em>late</em> at this point, but I'd definitely lost track of time and was caught a bit off-guard.</p>
<p>I quickly head back to the truck to grab my suit and pack my bag, then head over to the gym for a quick shower. I make myself pretty, pick up my friend, and we head off to the holiday party.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v4A7n8QDZmZbhQxdnSKX48PZq_Vcrcd0yNb8sqEVrrH0P4HnpsgThewHv3FyTNj9kZJSh8SGClsX-Q9I9bD5_CjsS8DfAog3FIBA=s600"/>
<p>Looks like I can add "giving people bunny ears" to the list of things I'm not good at, alongside "snowboarding", "dancing like Beyonce", and "knowing where my truck is".<sup><sup>Foreshadowing!</sup></sup></p>
</div>
<h3>Sunday</h3>
<p>It's Sunday afternoon. The holiday party was a blast, my friend and I are in San Jose eating avocado toast and drinking overpriced lattes like the Hipster Millennial Trash&#8482; we are. We finish our discussion on the merits of heated Vinyasa flow goat yoga<sup>kidding</sup>, and check out the <a href="https://www.thetech.org/">Tech Museum</a>, conveniently across the street from our hotel.*** After a few hours of pure educational bliss, we say goodbye to the museum and San Jose.</p>
<p>The next item on my grand weekend agenda is snowboarding. A few months ago, I got a season-long snowboard rental, and I keep it in the truck (usually just leaned against the wall). I call my friends in SF and tell them that I'm going to grab my board and I'll head up after. I get back to my usual stomping grounds and&#8230;</p>
<p class="text-center">The truck isn't there.</p>
<h2>Searching for Answers&#8230;and my Truck</h2>
<p>There's something uniquely strange (and strangely unique) about losing track of your home. I wouldn't describe it as bad, just a bit disorienting. I try not to take too much for granted, but I guess I've come to expect the truck to be, you know, where I left it. So I'll be honest, I wasn't prepared for the truck's disappearing act, even if I'm always joking about the truck burning down having a negligible impact on my day.</p>
<p>At first I thought I had done something wrong, even if I couldn't say exactly <em>what</em>. I did a lap around the block, as if the truck would suddenly and miraculously reappear once I rounded that last bend. Much to my chagrin, it didn't. Had I parked it somewhere else perhaps? On a few previous occasions, I'd gone on a bike ride and absent-mindedly returned to the wrong place, but even after racking my brain, I couldn't remember moving it before I had left.</p>
<p>At this point I assume it's been towed or stolen, but which, and <em>why</em>, and <strong>when</strong>, and <em><strong>how</strong></em>? I have the only set of keys and I always habitually lock the doors. Plus, the area I was parked in isn't known for auto thefts. Plus plus, I had seen it ~24 hours ago, so there's a fairly narrow window of time to consider. I conclude that it probably wasn't stolen, which I guess is a good thing. I put on my sleuthing hat and get to work.</p>
<p>The first thing I do is knock on the door of my nearest "neighbor", and explain I'm the guy with the decrepit white box truck, and ask if they might perhaps know where it is. They (quite helpfully) explain that it was towed earlier in the day (Sunday), and even recount their (much appreciated, but ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to convince the towing company that they probably have the wrong vehicle. They suggest I check in with the police department and find out what happened.</p>
<p>Cool, so the truck's been towed. At least that eliminates a whole swath of hilarious-but-probably-messy-and-annoying-to-deal-with truckjacking situations. I call the local police station, they look up my vehicle, give me a case number, and tell me that I can pick it up tomorrow morning, they open at 7 am.</p>
<p>My first thought was, "Damn, guess I can't go snowboarding."</p>
<p>My second thought was, "Damn, now I'm even more houseless than usual."</p>
<p>I call my friend and give them the bad news: my house has been towed away, which means I have no snowboard or gear. Worse, I have to go pick it up tomorrow morning, so I can't go to Tahoe. They suggest I come up to SF anyway to hang, and save on the cost of the hotel room I likely would have rented. I think this is a great idea, and I drive my car to SF.</p>
<h2>Picking up the Pieces</h2>
<p>After a night in SF chock full of gourmet garlic bread and Pitch Perfect 3, I head back to South Bay, ready to get my affairs back in order.</p>
<p>My morning looks roughly like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait for police station to open</li>
<li>Drive car to police station (7 am, <em>sharp</em>)</li>
<li>Pay $155 vehicle release fee (ouch)</li>
<li>Request a copy of the police report (because why not)</li>
<li>Grab a leisurely breakfast, wait for tow yard to open</li>
<li>Drive car to tow yard, ask for a copy of the police paperwork they received</li>
<li>Pay $500 to get my truck back (big ouch)</li>
<li>Drive truck back (I've yet to assess "the damage")</li>
<li>Walk back to car at tow yard (~2 miles, but it was a gorgeous day)</li>
<li>Drive car back (Thus ending my rousing game of Vehicle Juggling&#8482;)</li>
<li>Assess the damage</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Damage</h2>
<p>At this point, I'm down $655 and up one box truck. Speaking of the box truck, it has definitely seen better days:</p>

<p>The lock on the back had been cut, and there were marks from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_jim_(lock_pick)">slim jim</a> the towing company had used to get into the truck, but those (thankfully) wiped away.</p>
</div>
<p>The truck looked like a cyclone hit it, my mattress thoroughly divorced from my bed frame among other things. All in all, a confusing state of affairs. Why cut the lock <em>and</em> hack open the front door? Either one alone would have been just fine, thankyouverymuch. Let's see if the report from the towing company answers any questions:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8ZPk1JG4qzzRN77OCuNvtxiynD_yYX_m0jKZZz1RW5ZoKPRSTvEjQdPsnxrUTQOHLJ398GrF74XPlzeWHdq_gztm1wmgmXM6voJEaQ=s700"/>
<p>I can add 'scanning documents' to my list of things I'm not great at, but I'm pretty proud of my redacting work.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>My truck is described as a '2010 CHEVY'.  In reality, it's a 2006 Ford. Close, but no cigar.</li>
<li>The officer values my humble abode at between $501 and $4000. I personally take offense to this.</li>
<li>The 'REASON FOR STOP' section has something scribbled out, then says '72 HRS PARKED'.</li>
<li>The condition of the tires is marked as something that's hard to make out (even before my questionable scanning job), but appears to say 'POOR'.</li>
<li>The highlighted section says 'SNOWBOARD IN BACK'.</li>
</ol>
<p>My first thought was that they mistakenly towed the wrong vehicle, given the year/make/model were wrong. I'm usually pretty good about driving the truck at regular intervals, mostly to charge the battery, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/obvious-facts-about-box-trucks-2-theyre-great-for-moving-things/5691726094139392">help folks move</a>, and generally make sure things are in working order. That said, I very well may have been parked there for 72 hours, I have no evidence one way or the other.</p>
<p>I got the full police report a few days later. It's covered in scary watermarks that indicate I shouldn't post it here, so I'll just grab a few entertaining excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a padlock on the back of the truck, which I attempted to saw through, but my department issued electric saw ran out of battery power to finish the cutting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that explains the padlock nonsense. They had cut the <em>wrong side</em> of the lock. If they had cut the other one first, they would have been able to open it before their battery died.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the fact, Sgt. [REDACTED] noticed an opening between the front and the storage area. Sgt. [REDACTED] and I had never seen this set up before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm flattered I can add some novelty to humdrum of routine police work. But this was also a misstep on my part. In my rush to get to the holiday party, I hadn't closed my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-ugly-truckling/5675267779461120">new(ish) interior door</a>, so they could see straight from the doorway into my living/bed room, so to speak. That's certainly cause for them to investigate further.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Towing company] arrived to store the RV per [some regulation]. The tow driver unlocked the truck, where I entered to do an inventory check of the back. There was a bed, new snowboard and miscellanous (sic) items in the truck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Unlocked" is quite the euphemism here. Up until I read this report, I hadn't realized they had actually explored the back of the truck. Aside from the general icky feeling you get when other people rummage through your things, I was surprised they could, from a legal perspective, just go into the truck and look around. But I checked with a few legal-type folks, and the general consensus is that <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">4th amendment</a> protections don't apply as strongly to vehicles, even if you happen to live in them. I've heard similar stories from friends who have had their RV doors pried open by police.</p>
<h2>The Depressing Part</h2>
<p>There are a lot of things that went <em>right</em> with my situation. The truck disappeared and reappeared within a day. The impact on my life was minor and short-lived. I stayed at a friend's house, paid a fee, and picked up a new lock. Hell, I had a great time tracking down and retrieving the truck, it was a mini-adventure for me. But all of this is only true because I have the resources to not care about it. After all, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/opinion/flat-fines-wealthy-poor.html">crimes where the only punishment is a fine are effectively legal for those who can afford it</a>. As an absurd example, the cost of living here means that I could park somewhere convenient and illegal, and if the only punishment is a parking ticket, it'd still literally be cheaper for me to pay it <strong>every single day</strong> than renting anywhere in a 15 mile radius.</p>
<p><a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-aftermath/5655608640405504">I've talked about</a> how my story is only entertaining because I'm doing it for <em>fun</em>. The fact of the matter is that most people living in vehicles are doing it because they can't afford housing, or paying for housing would dramatically reduce the quality of life for them, and sometimes their families as well. What happens to someone in that situation when their vehicle gets unexpectedly towed?</p>
<p>They find themselves truly homeless. Not only that, they now have to come up with ~$650 just to get their home back. That's a scary situation to be in, and it's not obvious to me what they should even do at that point. In a world where <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-finances/index.html">40% of Americans can't cover a $400 emergency expense</a>, this isn't even just a hypothetical example, and people living in vehicles are already a particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p>Playing devil's advocate for a second: you could argue that, if their vehicle is so important to them, they should make sure it doesn't get towed. But life happens, mistakes happen. And in my case, it's not even obvious to me that my vehicle had been parked the requisite 72 hours before being towed.</p>
<p>In any case, homelessness and affordable housing are hard problems, and there's no silver bullet solution to fixing them. I plan on dedicating a full post to discussing this at some point.</p>

<em>Source: <span>Actual footage of me trying to write an essay to win this contest.</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I can't remember where on The Internet&#8482; I originally saw it, but at some point in the past few months I came across <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-selling-canada-mansion-essay-contest-cheap-calgary-2019-1">an article</a> about a woman selling her preposterously picturesque home in Canada for the low, low price of $19 and an essay of (at most) 350 words.

<p>The catch here (because houses usually cost more than nineteen dollars) is that you have to win the contest (i.e. have the bestest essay), and the woman running the contest needs to receive enough entries to cover what would normally be the asking price of the house, which happens to be $1.3 million USD. Crunching the (two) numbers here, that means ~68,000 people need to enter to effectively subsidizing the cost of this home for one lucky (and probably Canadian) duck.</p>
<p>As a dude who, uncoerced, writes rambling essays for random internet strangers, and regularly spends more than $19 on <em>way</em> worse things*, entering this contest seems like a no-brainer. There's even a prompt, which is like adding mental bowling bumpers to keep me from getting too sidetracked. Without further adieu, I present to you my answer to the question:</p>
<p class="text-center"><em>Why would moving to this lakefront dream home change your life?</em></p>
<h2>The Entry</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't have a lot of words to spare, so let me cut to the chase: I live in a truck, I'm very happy with it, and I have no intention of living in your home.</p>
<p><strong>My claim:</strong> Houses are expensive, it's overwhelming likely that whoever wins your contest will have to sell it to pay the (inevitable) small fortune in taxes, which kinda defeats the purpose and spirit of the contest.</p>
<p><strong>My proposition</strong>: If I win, I'll place the home in the care of a property management company. They'll find a renter, take their cut, and I'll donate the rest to charity. No strings attached. If it can be made legally binding, I'll happily sign on the dotted line before taking ownership of the home. If I ever sell the home, I'll donate those proceeds too.</p>
<p>Okay, with that out of the way, let's preemptively answer some questions.</p>
<p>Why do you live in a truck?</p>
<p>Housing in San Francisco is expensive. My [REDACTED] employer has all the amenities (gyms, food, laundry) I could ever need, so when I moved out to California nearly four years ago, I bought a box truck and threw a bed in the back. The rest is history, documented (sporadically) on my blog, FromInsideTheBox.com.</p>
<p>What charity will you donate to?</p>
<p>My personal preference is GiveDirectly, but that's too easy. My first order of business as New Canadian House Owner&#8482; will be building a silly website (ala my day job) where people can vote on what charity to donate to. I'll call it HomelessHomeownerDonations.com or hopefully something catchier. Since the contest has already generated a bit of fanfare, I don't imagine I'll have a problem finding people to suggest and vote on charities.</p>
<p>What about your family?</p>
<p>Aside from having to endure harsh(ish) Boston winters, my family is doing just fine. I bought my [REDACTED] a house last year (so I'm already technically a homeless homeowner), meaning [they're] not really in a position to complain.</p>
<p>Anyway, let me know what you think, happy to discuss further.</p>
<p>Brandon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've been here before, you're probably familiar with most of the contents of my three-hundred and forty-three word essay above, but I had to catch our new Canadian friend up to speed. Probably the only new/surprising thing in there is that I'd be willing to donate the money, rather than, well, keep it for myself. There's roughly two reasons why I'd opt to donate the proceeds:</p>
<ol>
<li>It'd help me win the contest.</li>
<li>I've been trying to get into Effective Altruism.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first reason is pretty self-explanatory. If my answer to the question "Why would moving to this lakefront dream home change [my] life?" is just "I like money and want even more of it", that's not particularly compelling or inspiring.</p>
<p>The second reason is probably the more interesting one, so let's talk about that.</p>
<h2>A Philosophy on Giving</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruism</a> is a philosophy centered on maximizing the good you can do in the world with the resources you have. I'd heard about the idea before, but was more formally introduced when a friend gave me <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OYXWL4W">a book on the topic</a> for our yearly Secret Santa (thanks Joy!).</p>
<p>To be clear: I haven't actually finished the book yet, so I'm really not that well-versed in the details of Effective Altruism. The parts that I have read discuss different tools you can use to help evaluate how 'good' different (and seemingly incomparable) causes are. If nothing else, that seems pretty useful.</p>
<p>The main criticism I've heard of Effective Altruism is that it sucks all of the fun out of donating. For example, a strict adherent probably wouldn't donate to an animal shelter, or even give money to a homeless person, knowing that that money could literally save human lives in a third-world country.** <em>Really</em> strict adherents might choose careers to maximize their impact, which seems pretty hardcore to me (but power to them). I've also noticed that people I personally know who subscribe to Effective Altruism tend to also subscribe to fringe philosophies and movements that border on cult-y. That could just be because I know weird people in general though.</p>
<p>Circling back to my essay: having a side income (i.e. rental property in Canada) that I can dedicate wholly to donating is an easy way to increase my impact, outside of the (admittedly limited) donating I already do. The other (decidedly less altruistic) thing that would be nice about winning the contest, which I didn't have enough words to explain, is that I get to claim all of those donations as tax deductions, which is great for a dude who accidentally underpaid his taxes by $17,000 this past <del>fiscal</del> year.*** Then again, there's no reason I can't donate on those tax savings as well.</p>
<p>In any case, we'll see what happens&#8230;as soon as I figure out how to send $19 to Canada.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">Like mermaid costumes, hotdog onesies, and a small armada of novelty websites.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Animal_welfare">Wikipedia informs me</a> that lots of effective altruists do indeed care about animals. I don't think I've read that chapter yet.</em></p>
<p>***<em class="small">The proximate cause of my tax kerfuffle is a combination of changing tax laws and me having my <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/irs-withholding-calculator">withholdings</a> set too low, which I've fixed for 2019. I didn't have to pay a penalty because the amount I paid was <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306">&gt;100% of my previous year's taxes</a>. Interestingly, the <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-3-of-3-a-house/5696459148099584">house purchase</a> had a net zero impact on my taxes.</em></p>

</h1>
</div>
<p class="blog-post-meta">February 10, 2019 at 8:58 PM</p>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Recently, a reader of this blog tracked me down on Facebook and asked me a very interesting question. Just to be clear, I don't recommend doing this (even if I am indulging this behavior by writing this post). I may be terrible at answering questions, but I'm somewhat responsive <a href="mailto:brandonATfrominsidetheboxDOTcom" onmouseover="this.href=this.href.replace(/AT/,'@').replace(/DOT/,'.')">over email</a>, so maybe try me there first.</p>
<p>Anyway, the question went something <em>roughly</em> like:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F0UH63v2-S-FDDazFLcOlC0yFSfYeZ1AYfrVarumreLKykcEvwPlK6eYwXGfT16iguy2CctpuxJlhayZJtcw2NgPZavxE7pPysuRog=s500"/>
<p>And by <em>roughly</em>, I mean <em>exactly</em>, given that I took a screenshot of the question.</p>
</div>
<p>There's a few reasons I find this question interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>I spend a lot of time thinking about my money.</li>
<li>I spend a lot of time thinking about what I want out of life.</li>
<li>I'm not sure I agree with the premise.</li>
</ol>
<p>I responded on Facebook with an incoherent wall of text, as I am wont to do. For this post, I'm going to attempt to organize and format my ramblings into a semi-intelligible post.</p>
<h2>Trade-offs?</h2>
<p>The core of the question assumes that 'saving money' and 'experiencing life' are fundamentally ('somewhat') in conflict, which makes sense, to a certain degree: Doing stuff costs money, doing stuff is a key part of experiencing life, so it stands to reason that experiencing life costs money. The counter-argument I'd make here is that <strong>we're in control of how much those two things are in conflict</strong>.</p>
<p>Our lives are made of a billion different knobs that we can tweak: how many jobs do we want to have, what hobbies do we pursue, who do we spend our time with, what shows/books/media do we consume, etc, etc. I think that one of the most important sets of knobs we can tweak are the knobs that control how we define success* within our own lives. Once you define what success is, 'experiencing life' is just the vehicle we use to be successful.</p>
<p>For example, if success for you means 'having lots of nice things', experiencing life is probably going to involve buying lots of nice things, which will limit your ability to save. On the other hand, if success means 'challenging yourself to be better', experiencing life can be done pretty cheaply.</p>
<p>I'm obviously oversimplifying things, and everyone's idea of 'success' is going to be different and way more complicated than my examples above. That said, the premise is still true, we can control how much experiencing life impacts our ability to save.</p>
<h2>To what end?</h2>
<p>The other assumption baked into the question is that the questioner's idea of success involves saving money. Now, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Money">I'm all for saving money</a>, but having money for the sake of money isn't all that useful. Money is a means to an end. If you have the means to reach that end, more money doesn't really do anything for you. This is largely in line with the idea that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0">people don't seem to get any happier after they make about $105,000 a year</a>. So for those cases where 'saving money' and 'experiencing life' are in conflict, it makes sense to ask what you're saving for, how much it will cost, and when you want it by.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the game of 'saving money' becomes an infinitely deep rabbit hole. Without a target or concrete motive, it's easy to drive yourself insane trying to optimize every little expenditure in your life. I try to focus on just the top three or so costs (or potential costs) in my life, like rent, food, and medical expenses**. I figure that once the larger expenses in my life are managed, I've done my due diligence and can cut myself some slack in other areas that account for a much smaller percentage of possible expenses.</p>
<h2>Reflecting</h2>
<p>Applying all of this to my own personal experience: I've tried to define <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/welcome-to-2018/5679846214598656">what success means to me</a> before. It's been a year and change since I wrote that though, so let's take another crack at it. Success to me means getting stronger/faster/smarter than I was before, cultivating the relationships I care about, exploring my hobbies (travel, blogging, etc), and <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-3-of-3-a-house/5696459148099584">eventually</a> being financially independent.</p>
<p>Financial independence definitely requires saving money, but it's relatively easy to put an upper bound on just <em>how much</em> money. For example, I'd like to be financially independent before 40 and be able to buy a modest home in a relatively low cost-of-living area and support either a small family or a few large dogs.</p>
<p>Let's say that I'd need $60,000 a year to do that comfortably. Using a conservative <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-withdrawal-rate-swr-method.asp">safe withdrawal rate</a> of 3%, I'll need to save $2 million before I'm 40 to make it happen. I can subtract how much I've currently saved from that $2 million, assume a 4% growth on my investments and get a rough idea of how much I need to save per year to reach that goal. Doing the math, it works out to <em>less</em> than I'm currently saving, which is to say I shouldn't let 'saving money' get in the way of my other success metrics.</p>
<p>One way that I want to 'experience life' is by catching the <a href="http://eclipsewise.com/oh/ec2019.html#SE2019Jul02T">total solar eclipse in July</a>, which means travelling to South America. I had traveled to Oregon with some friends to catch the total solar eclipse in 2017, and the experience was sufficiently life-changing that I'd like to make a hobby out of it. Knowing that I'm saving enough money to make my other goals work out in the long run means that they aren't in conflict with each other.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I say 'success' instead of 'happiness', because I don't think that happiness is necessarily the goal to strive for. <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy">This Oatmeal comic</a> explains it pretty well.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">I "control" my medical expenses by taking care of my body (and teeth) and just being supremely lucky that I don't have any chronic illnesses.</em></p>

I'll try to avoid straying into retrospective/reflection territory, as I've already done enough of that <del>this year</del> last year, but no promises.</p>
<h2>Finding a Rhythm</h2>
<p>I'm a creature of habit. I like a healthy amount of structure in my life, and <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-day-in-the-life-weekday-edition/5645478960037888">I have a routine</a> that provides it. Even my spontaneity is <sup>usually</sup> structured; I set aside the same rough time frame every weekend to do something new and hopefully weird. Whether or not that's really sad is up for debate.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it's probably no surprise that my crowning truck achievement is how <em>little</em> has changed recently. It took me the better part of two years to figure out a winning formula for what I want out of the truck (and in it), but my setup has stayed largely the same since <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-8-starting-over/5720605454237696">I threw out everything and bought new stuff</a>, which was nearly a year and a half ago. In other words,  I think I've reached Truck Homeostasis&#8482;**. </p>
<p>Truck Homeostasis looks something like the following: a small sunroof for ventilation, an interior door for security and slightly less sketchy ingress + egress, a giant storage cabinet (and associated organization system), and a raised bed frame for putting shoes and a few select items that don't fit in the storage cabinet.</p>

<p>Oh look, it's the vast majority of everything I own.</p>
</div>
<p>In recent memory, things have been pretty boring, but like, in a no-news-is-good-news kinda way. I've settled into my role as <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-3-of-3-a-house/5696459148099584">The Homeless Homeowner</a>&#8482;, rolling with the ebbs and flows of mortgage payments and home repairs, and everything is on the right level of auto-pilot. As a result, there's really only a few vaguely noteworthy events worth rambling about, which is what I'll spend the rest of this post doing.<p>
<h2>Seeing Double</h2>
<p>An unfortunate side effect of being alive is consuming stuff, and sometimes that stuff hangs out for longer than you'd like. A pair of hiking shoes here, a sexy mermaid costume there, and on occasion, a birthday gift you don't quite have the heart to reject. Over time, even with the most diligent of cruft-control efforts, you end up with stuff you don't necessarily need. Luckily, the truck has no problem reminding me when I have too much stuff, just by virtue of being small.</p>
<p>This time around though, I noticed that not only did I have more things than I cared to, but more specifically I had duplicates of a lot of really random things. Like, for example, backpacks.</p>
<h3>Backpacks</h3>
<p>There are a few things I'm a total sucker for: good headphones, good notebooks/pencils/pens, and <strong>good backpacks</strong>. There's nothing like having a solid organizational system for schlepping around all of your garbage, which is extra important to me because I spend most of my time at places that aren't my "house". And one size doesn't always fit all, the system I use for carting around a full workday's worth of gym clothes, work clothes, and laptop(s) doesn't make a ton of sense for a long bike ride, which also doesn't make sense for organizing multi-week trips. Try to optimize for too many situations, and eventually you end up with this.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ieAT-3x0oA80RwM0i_AFPA7vKGMXDAp8XLE39DXyNBOqfG1oSX972CrB9BJUNuRAGobSFQdB_xE9USS5gt3dzRN53iscw8Ju1T4=s450"/>
</div>
<p>Five, count 'em, five different bags. From top-left, clockwise: one duffle for traveling, one steal-proof drawstring sack <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/967296713/the-theft-proof-drawstring-backpack">from a KickStarter</a>, one everyday backpack gifted by my employer, one lightweight bag for hiking, and one for, well, <a href="https://www.goruck.com/our-rucksacks/">everything else</a>. Comprehensive? Yes. Entirely necessary? Not a chance.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes it's just plain hard to get rid of things. At some point in the past, I wholeheartedly believed I <em>needed</em> each one of these bags, despite knowing full well that having five bags is a bit silly. I managed to convince myself that I could get by with three, and I bit the proverbial bullet and donated the other two. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure out which bags I thought were superfluous and which were necessary.</p>
<p>Product area number two where I was seeing double (or triple, in this case): novelty outfits.</p>
<h3>Erhm&#8230;"Novelty Outfits"</h3>
<p>I wouldn't describe my wardrobe as "colorful" or "interesting" or "good". I wear a lot of black and grey and otherwise uninspired colors, mostly because I own like a week-and-a-half's worth of clothes, and I don't want them to be too memorable, lest people recognize how weirdly limited my outfit rotation is. If we're being honest here, the more adventurous parts of my wardrobe are all past years' Christmas gifts from my (Jewish) mother, who actually has a surprisingly well-tuned sense for men's fashion.</p>
<p>Boring wardrobe aside, I also own a few outfits reserved for special occasions. Not 'special' like weddings or white-tie affairs, more like <a href="https://www.baytobreakers.com/">Bay to Breakers</a> or Halloween or the odd Ugly Sweater party.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LKN-ffwPdFnFRetDrkv2fsnlMubFCe4_XaMNEbGe_H37wd5V-jNllHELGlWSyhAoHcxX8Evx0LfUlgWfXow2eXkcaX6J2hkz4PyVwg=s500"/>
</div>
<p>Again, three novelty items here is looking a little crowded. The ugly sweater I got because I love pandas (in all their derpy glory), and wanted to be an active participant in each winter's barrage of Ugly Sweater parties. I also wear it once or twice in the middle of summer, just to make sure it doesn't get too lonely. The hotdog costume is reserved for races and onesie parties, and I bought the mermaid costume a few Halloweens ago as a protest against a good friend always having the flashiest costume. Personally, I like to think I did it justice.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zeTSNVBVevJ1Tb6UbL6yMdTFYsrMNjAe-DG_YFjFDtMPjUuT6U-habecDgVLGqgxtdorTM4bCRUZ4vHTF2kfXGcQ-XDgiTo2iR4-=s400"/>

<p>Bringing back the BlurryFace&#8482; treatment to showcase the more fringe items in my Seasonal Collection. Yes, I blurred out the octopus face.</p>
</div>
<p>In the end, I couldn't bring myself to actually get rid of any of these. They're all uniquely suited to a different subset of festive occasions, not to mention I haven't yet gotten my money's worth out of the mermaid costume. I have however resolved to not acquire any <em>more</em> pieces of novelty attire, if that counts for anything.</p>
<h3>Jackets</h3>
<p>I had too many jackets.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FlSKrAw0-5caSr4yfYi6rKuZSCcv-6UdjNivltuG9gpqBEnXXLVrS5oB483cwp_idKGLRMZrzHKJ6rzLJd9QuXp1-URoebhIcDgWQ=s500"/>
<p>A jacket for travelling to cold climates (<a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-land-of-fire-and-ice/5666313846390784">featured here</a>), a jacket for brisk days, a jacket for a motorcycle I don't own, and a jacket for reliving my ever-more-distant college days.</p>
</div>
<p>This one was easy. I think I've semi-successfully navigated my quarter-life crisis, so I donated the motorcycle jacket and the college sweatshirt. I still own a "UMass" shirt in case I ever need to pretend I'm a college student.</p>
<p>That concludes our tour through my closet/general <del>spring</del> winter cleaning efforts. Let's talk about vaguely noteworthy event #2.</p>
<h3>An Old Enemy Returns</h3>
<p>This was originally supposed to be the section of this post where I congratulated myself on not having any <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/pest-problems/5759778777202688">pest-related problems</a> for over three years. Unfortunately that's an accolade I no longer get to give myself, because I recently came back to the truck and made the following mental observation:</p>
<p class="text-center"><em>"Huh, why does the floor look like it's moving? Weird."</em></p>
<p>This thought was immediately followed by an overwhelming sinking feeling and a sense of impending doom, as I realized my floor had been replaced (quite suddenly, might I add) with an entire army of tiny ants. I really cannot overstate how thoroughly they covered the floor, their intricate crisscrossing paths like the factory floor of a giant warehouse or sorting facility. Like, if I had a dollar for every tiny ant on the floor of the truck, I'd probably have bought a house in San Francisco <strong><em>that night</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Luckily (and perhaps unfortunately), this wasn't entirely unfamiliar territory for me: I have an entire arsenal of critter-killing cocktails that I keep in a small (and hopefully well-sealed) plastic bin in my storage cabinet. Given that there were ants coming and going every which way, I couldn't really tell where they were coming from (if it was indeed only one location), so I opened up my plastic death bin and liberally placed ant traps all around the truck. The saving grace (and reason I could sleep at all that night) is that the ants seemed content to stay on the floor; they weren't crawling up the walls or (<em>**deep internal shudder**</em>) on my bed.</p>
<p>What was particularly perplexing to me is that I had no idea what drew the ants to the truck. I keep <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-1-no-food/5643440998055936">literally nothing edible</a> in the truck for exactly this reason. My best guess is that there was something about the wooden floor, perhaps something edible kicked up onto the underside of it. The onslaught came hot on the heels of the first (or maybe second?) rain of the season, so maybe that had something to do with it?</p>
<p>In any case, when I came back the next night, things were in much better shape, and the invasion was limited to a few hotspots along the walls. So I swept out a horrifyingly large dust cloud of dead ant debris, ripped out <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-project-7-let-there-be-light-and-heat-and-stuff/5694639155707904">the insulation</a> around the hotspots, did some more sweeping, then sealed the areas where the floor meets the walls with a heavy-duty construction adhesive, which I probably should have done years ago.</p>
<p>The infestation seems to be contained (knock on wood), as I haven't seen any ants in the past week or so, but I'll probably rip out the rest of the insulation and seal the rest of the floor just to prevent it from happening again.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that's about it, the current state of truck affairs all accounted for. Oh, and happy New Year! This obviously wasn't a New Year-related post, but that's probably fine. As my next order of business, I plan on catching up on my long-neglected blog email inbox.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I haven't actually bothered to check this, but I'd be willing to bet that my output of blog posts trends downwards during the later months of the year, because I usually spend all of my free time August-December building a Christmas game/website for my hometown friends, where they fight for a varying number of inappropriately sized cash prizes. Past years' games have included clones of Cards Against Humanity, Texas Hold 'Em, Bomberman, Bananagrams, and Tetris.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">Tromeostasis?  Nah never mind, that sounds terrible.</em></p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p class="text-center"><em>I'm completely going to ignore the fact it's been four month since I wrote last. <br/>Writing is hard sometimes.</em></p>
<p>When I started the blog, I talked a lot about my travel ambitions, mostly about my romantic and hyper-idealized fantasies about perpetually travelling. <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/objects-in-the-mirror/5663284820705280">My thoughts on the topic</a> have shifted a bit, but the core reasoning still stands: I think travel is the best way to expand your understanding of the world and the people in it.</p>
<p>While I've definitely stepped up my travel game in the past few years, most of my trips have been planned by other people (friends, work, significant other, etc). Even though they've all been great trips, I want to start doing solo trips, which means being a more active participant in the whole trip planning process. The logical first step is to figure out some sort of process for planning these new Big Boy Solo Trips&#8482; of mine. After much thought (read: no thought), I came up with the following proposal.</p>
<h2>The Proposal</h2>
<p>I'll take (roughly) two solo trips a year: one will be domestic, one will be international. The domestic trip(s) will probably be decided by what flights are on sale and/or fair dice roll. The international trip will be chosen via the following Very Serious&#8482; 10-step system:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wait until a particularly whimsical mood strikes.</strong> If you're also feeling wanderlust-y, that helps too.</li>
<li><strong>Bike aimlessly until you find a book store.</strong> Try to find a different book store every time you do this, for maximum whimsy.</li>
<li><strong>Enter the book store.</strong> Act casual.</li>
<li><strong>Find the travel/travel guide section.</strong> If they don't have a travel section, <del>the cooking section will do just fine</del> restart at step 1.</li>
<li><strong>Close your eyes.</strong> Bear with me here.</li>
<li><strong>Spin around, preferably 3-5 times.</strong> Trust me, this is very normal and won't look weird to fellow book store-goers.</li>
<li><strong>With eyes still closed, pick a travel guide off the shelf.</strong> You can probably see where we're going at this point.</li>
<li><strong>Buy the travel guide.</strong> Money can be exchanged for goods and services.</li>
<li><strong>Read the travel guide.</strong> This step might take some time, you can exit the book store at this point, leaving patrons to wonder what just happened.</li>
<li><strong>Travel somewhere entirely unrelated.</strong> Just kidding, travel to the location in the travel guide.</li>
</ol>
<p>If that system sounds weirdly specific, it's because I already did steps #1 through #8, and I'm retroactively formalizing it. Last month (on a particularly whimsical and wanderlust-y day), I went on a post-work bike ride to nowhere in particular, and ended up at a book store, in the travel section, with my eyes closed, feeling slightly dizzy. I ended up walking out with the following:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YcBU9WIqoJ2tlqFJUxpnD6mzx79ii2CcjLnb3CedlIjuuhil8APvbogux_YW854EHJr2PGAOh7PqMfjpWTLMnzFlOcG8JE8l-tI=s600"/>
<p>The fruits of my first-ever Very Serious&#8482; 10-step system run-through, naturally under sketchy box truck lighting.</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see from above, my first solo, personal, international travel destination will be Taiwan, and I'm looking forward to learning about it over the course of the next few months. Turning my <sup><sup>short</sup></sup> attention <sup><sup>span</sup></sup> to domestic travel, I actually recently went on my first solo, personal, domestic trip, which was to Austin, Texas, and was a genuinely wonderful time.</p>
<p>Why Austin though? That's a long story, perhaps for another post. Though I will say, the choice was based not on price nor dice. Don't worry, a fair amount of whimsy was still <em>most definitely</em> involved.</p>

<em>Source: <span>This isn't the house I bought, but if I was going to design my own, it'd probably look something like this.

House from <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/modern-house-exterior/all">Architectural Digest</a>.</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>My life may or may not consist of a series of questionable (and sometimes poorly thought out) choices that are <em>ever so slightly</em> outside my comfort zone. Even with a long line of shaky choices to choose from, a recent choice (and the topic of this post) might mark the climax of my personal brand of impulsive opportunism.</p>
<p>Since I'm wholly unable to structure my posts for dramatic effect and gave away the surprise in the title, what I'm trying to say is: I bought a house. Don't worry though, the house is 3,000 miles away and I still totally live in a truck.</p>
<h2>Wait, what?</h2>
<p>It's a sad fact of reality that despite having a decent job and pocketing/investing all of my rent-savings by living in a truck for the past three years, I'm not anywhere <em>remotely</em> near the <em>realm</em> of having the <em>luxury</em> of considering the <em>idea</em> of potentially almost <em>thinking</em> about purchasing a home in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>But, with that same decent job and rent-savings, I'm perfectly well-equipped to buy a home many other places in the country, including around my hometown, for example. In fact, if you squint a bit, three years of Bay Area rent is a pretty solid down payment in a lot of places. So when a close family member lamented their frequently rising rents and frustrations trying to get a mortgage, I had an idea.</p>
<p>My thought went something like this: I could buy a home, and they could live in it and fix it up to their liking (their significant other is a contractor, who fixes houses for a living). When they move elsewhere, I can finish paying off the mortgage in one lump payment and start renting it out, or even sell it if I so desire.</p>
<p>So that's what I've been up to for the past few months: making offers on homes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Boston">Greater Boston</a> area. About two months ago, one of my offers was accepted, and a few hectic weeks later, I flew out to Boston to <del>sign my soul and first-born child away</del> close the deal and help the aforementioned family member move in. It's definitely weird to say, but as of May 24th, 2018, I'm officially a homeowner. Just to reiterate, I still live in a truck though.</p>
<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>Not that I ever intended for it to be this way, but the blog tends to be pretty family-friendly. I mean it makes sense, I'd really have to go out of my way to make a blog about box trucks overtly risqu&#233; or indecent. Allow me to trample all over that for a brief second with some PG-13 language:</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Buying a house is a f***ing process.</strong></p>
<p>Not only is it a process, but (as one might expect) living in a truck <em>and</em> being 3,000 miles away doesn't make it any easier. If you've never bought a home (3,000 miles away) (while living in a truck) before, the process looks roughly like this:</p>

<p>Whew, that was a doozy. I'm convinced that buying a house is made intentionally convoluted and counter-intuitive to make it as expensive as possible. If buying a house was straight-forward, our GDP would probably plummet. At every step of the process, it feels like there's a group of used car salesmen-types eagerly waiting to take your hard-earned money, and you can't help but laugh at the literal dozens of different fees itemized at closing. I can understand why people put in "all-cash" offers on homes, and why they're so attractive (the offers, not the people making them, though I guess being rich is attractive to some people).</p>
<p>In any case, it's over. It's done. Salient details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loan/insurance labelled as for a "second home".</strong> Because I won't be living in the home most of the time, except when I come home for holidays, none of the banks I talked to were willing to classify this as a "primary home" loan, which I find ironic, seeing as I don't have a primary home.</li>
<li><strong>~$2,300/month mortgage payment (including tax + insurance) on a 15-year loan.</strong> For a bit of perspective, this is less than what some of my SF-based friends pay in rent. I opted for a 15-year loan, instead of a more traditional 30-year loan, because I wanted to get a better rate. I bought the house at a bad time, just after mortgage rates skyrocketed. Since I knew I'd be holding onto the loan for a while (probably the whole lifetime of the loan), I opted to optimize for lower rates, at the expense of a higher monthly payment and slightly higher closing costs.</li>
<li><strong>20% down payment.</strong> To avoid private mortgage insurance, lock in a better rate, yada yada.</li>
<li><strong>4.125% interest rate.</strong> Not bad, though not great compared to rates even a few months earlier. Still a significantly better rate than if it had been classified as an investment property.</li>
<li><strong>Total out of pocket: ~$80,000.</strong> I sold a bunch of my index funds to cover it. Luckily, I'd had all of them for more than a year, so I'll get to pay for the gains at the long-term rate come tax time next year. I also used the opportunity to consolidate all of my investments into the <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/admiral-shares">Admiral Share</a> variants of the funds I invest in, which sometimes have slightly lower expense ratios and support buying fractional shares.</li>
<li><strong>Total home cost, after closing credit: $320,000.</strong> When discussing with my family member the price range I was willing to put in offers on, I think we agreed on $275,000 to $350,000, and this was comfortably in that price range. Though at one harrowing point in the home shopping process, I did put in a $370,000 offer on a home, nearly 10% over asking, and it was (perhaps thankfully) rejected.</li>
<li><strong>Two bedrooms, one bath.</strong> The home itself is pretty small, about 1,000 sqft. It sits on a ~9,500 sqft lot, and has a in-ground pool and a patio.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some Hiccups</h2>
<p>As noted above, there are a lot of moving pieces in the home-buying process, and not all of those pieces moved as smoothly as I might have liked. I'll talk about a few of the more entertaining ones.</p>
<h3>The Clock is Ticking</h3>
<p>Right off the bat, we had a pretty aggressive closing date, which was less than a month from the date of the offer. I'm told that this makes the offer more attractive because <del>it means the dozens of middle-men get paid sooner</del> the seller wants to be done with the sale as quickly as possible. This means that I had to be pretty quick in coordinating inspections and finding a mortgage and shuffling papers back and forth between interested parties, and that any subsequent hiccups had to be dealt with quickly.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Horrified</h3>
<p>The next wrench in the works was the inspection report. In hot housing markets (like the Bay Area), buyers usually waive their right to inspections because it's so competitive. Buying a house in Massachusetts meant I had the luxury of having a home inspection performed. The inspection itself was <em>extremely</em> thorough, which was problematic in the sense that it highlighted an overwhelming number of problems with the home. For example:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kN_TWG68zWWESoOciLseZLGSYsCkWGgd1Goz96XY7rv9Dg0V-eWH4PJ5nLtTdJaVhK9N6wsAaG5fOk5dLtEKUKFv8Q40x_kU1_OCzg=s700"/>
</div>
<p>This was the results of the "Exterior" section of the home report. You might notice that nothing was labelled as in "Good" condition, only "Fair" or "Poor". This was the general trend for other sections of the report as well, including the roof, basement, plumbing, electrical, etc. I probably shouldn't be surprised, given the house was built in the 1920s. In total, the report has 61 densely packed pages worth of findings (with pictures and diagrams and explanations, oh my!), each one enough to keep me tossing and turning at night with the specter of future home repairs looming over me.</p>
<p>In the end though, the problems weren't dire enough to warrant backing out of the purchase, even if I had the legal right to do so. Instead, I looked at the few most pressing and immediate repairs that would be necessary, and got some estimates for how much it would cost to fix each one. I ended up negotiating a $7,500 credit at closing (deducted from the closing costs). Originally, I had asked for a little bit more, but it turns out banks get spooked if you ask for more than a few percent of the total value of the home. C'est la vie.</p>
<h3>The Elephant in the Room</h3>
<p>Mortgage lenders (understandably) want to make sure you can pay back the money they're considering loaning out to you. As a matter of fact, this is so important to lenders that they have a whole department dedicated explicitly to this, called the underwriting department. They'll look at your income, assets, expenses, and various other aspects of your life to determine whether or not they think you can afford your mortgage payments for the foreseeable future. Particularly relevant to my case, they look at your current housing expenses.</p>
<p>When they asked me if I rent or own my current residence, I told them (in my most political voice) that I have an agreement worked out where I don't have to pay rent. It's technically true if you squint a bit, and I thought I was being pretty slick. Turns out it's their job to be slicker than I am, and indeed they are. They wanted proof of this alleged agreement, which naturally I couldn't furnish. So I had to spill the proverbial beans and tell them that I live in a truck.</p>
<p>At this point, I expected them to run for the hills. What respectable lender of sound mind and functional faculties wants to put hundreds of thousands of dollars in the unwashed hands of some truck-dwelling degenerate? But the underwriting department is far more pragmatic than I had giving them credit for. Instead of abandoning ship, they simply asked for proof that I owned the truck, and proof that I had insurance on it. It was literally written into the legal paperwork:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_FRmAh6WlTE2HP4i7rZFDxCQQ5MsCyIeMoHRdOM3f9AyC7gIiso-aB6bkx8hRLkwU3uo_zxmbF9vP3HwGnPa-pkkIGy89njoYIIz=s750"/>
<p>A snippet from the loan commitment document, redacted to protect my secret identity and highlighted to draw attention to the absurdity of my life.</p>
</div>
<p>I provided them a copy of the title, registration, most recent insurance policy, and a link to this blog for good measure (any new readers from Citizens Bank &#8212; hello!), and the process kept on rollin' along.</p>
<h3>Home Insurance</h3>
<p>This last hiccup I only include because I found it interesting, and it's not something I would have expected. Mortgage lenders want to ensure their home is insured in case of catastrophic acts of man or nature. That definitely makes sense. What makes slightly less sense, is that a few home insurers I spoke with won't insure a "second home" if they aren't also insuring your first home, probably so they can get more money from you. That means if you rent your main residence (or you live in a truck), there is no way to get insurance through certain providers (<em>cough</em> Liberty Mutual <em>cough</em>) on another property. Luckily, this isn't universally true, and I was able to secure insurance on the home after a few tries.</p>
<p>Okay, I think that covers most of the major hiccups/wrenches (or any other metaphor for unexpected difficulties you may prefer). Now let's talk about how bad of a decision this was.</p>
<h2>Crunching the Numbers</h2>
<p>In case you wanted some visual evidence of how terrible of a decision this was from a financial perspective, here's a graph:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EZCBQ5kMD-eNZE3HCJN4yNRr5xENNOkF9fWC4sWbDhIxNBOxhT1sjQfzkhuEA93aHKUZ7ufVsGw8kTNnmDBo5mFiK_3P360HCwM=s700"/>
<p>The larger the gap between the red and blue lines, the more money I'm hypothetically losing. With the set of arbitrary and made-up numbers I chose here, it's about ~$125,000 over the lifetime of the mortgage.</p>
</div>
<p>When I was trying to make sense of the finances involved, it made sense to compare buying a house with continuing to invest the money, like I've been doing. To get a sense of how the house would work as an investment, I modeled it after a hypothetical future where I could rent it out for a reasonable market rate. Here's what you're seeing:</p>
<p>The red line shows investment returns from what I'd have to take out to cover the down payment and closing costs, plus investing all of the money I would be spending on the mortgage every month. In terms of Excel/Google Sheets, the formula I came up with:</p>
<pre style="margin-left:2%;">=FV(
  <strong>Investment Return Rate</strong> / 12,
  <strong>Months Since Starting</strong>,
  -<strong>Monthly Mortgage Cost</strong>,
  -(<strong>Down Payment</strong> + <strong>Closing Costs</strong>),
  0
) - (<strong>Down Payment</strong> + <strong>Closing Costs</strong>)
</pre>
<p>where <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093224?hl=en">=FV</a> is a function for calculating the value of an investment with fixed monthly contributions (in this case, investing the money I'd otherwise be spending on the mortgage).</p>
<p>The blue line shows investment returns from investing a hypothetical rent ($1,800/month) minus all of the non-mortgage expenses (tax, insurance, repairs, etc), plus the non-interest portion of each mortgage payment to account for equity in the house. In terms of Excel/Google Sheets, this looks like:</p>
<pre style="margin-left:2%;">=FV(
  <strong>Investment Return Rate</strong> / 12,
  <strong>Months Since Starting</strong>,
  -(<strong>Hypothetical Rent</strong> - <strong>Monthly Non-Principal Home Costs</strong>),
  0,
  0
) + <strong>Months Since Starting</strong> * (<strong>Loan Principal</strong> / (<strong>Length Of Mortgage In Years</strong> * 12))
</pre>
<p>While this is a good ballpark estimate, there are some glaring omissions here. For example, both lines assume a constant "Investment Return Rate" of 4%, which is probably too low, but also doesn't account for any sort of capital gains taxes. Changing this to something higher, like 8%, widens the gap between the two lines. The blue line isn't accounting for depreciation/appreciation in the value of the house (which is especially hard to predict), or any of the potential tax incentives for owning a home.</p>
<p>In any case, the graph is moot because it assumes I'm collecting any rent, which isn't even an option since my loan is for a "second home" instead of an "investment property". That's because I decided the better interest rate was worth more than any subsidized rent would be. If I'm getting anything from the home now, it's coming from my family fixing it up, and hopefully a bit of appreciation in home value. Plus, it's hard to put a value on diversification, but I imagine it's probably good that I no longer have like 95% of my investments in stocks.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>An important question to ask at this point: how does all of this factor into my plans for financial independence/early retirement?</p>
<p>In short, it takes my plans, pulls their underwear clear over and around their head, kicks them to the ground, beats them to a pulp, sets them on fire, and snorts the ashes. </p>
<p>Before buying the house, my estimates for reaching financial independence were anywhere from 4-8 years. Now, I'm not really sure. A few months ago, this would have been a big deal for me, but <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/objects-in-the-mirror/5663284820705280">post-quarter-life crisis</a>, I'm less concerned with racing towards "retirement" and more focused on just living well.</p>
<p>If I did want to do the financial independence math, it gets a lot more fuzzy and hand-wavy now. On one hand, I took a big chunk (~25%) out of my nest egg and gave myself a fun, somewhat large, new recurring expense. On the other hand, it sets me up to have a consistent source of semi-passive income in the future.</p>
<p>I'm still maxing out all my tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but I'll conceivably be putting much less into my brokerage account. Having the mortgage might also inspire me to reign in some of my rampant "fun budget" spending, but who knows?</p>
<p>Anyway, this post is getting criminally long, so I'll just leave you with a fun fact: There are two words (not counting variations) in the English language that contain the letters m-e-o-w next to each other. One, naturally, is "meow". The other, perhaps less obviously, is "homeowner".</p>

<p>Here we are, item numero dos in our three-part mini-series about my recent (and highly suspect) purchases. Without further ado, here we go.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text-center">For some reason I'm not sure I understand yet, I bought a car.</p>
<h2>As Fate Would Have It</h2>
<p>I didn't just wake up one day (after living here for three years) and decide I wanted a car. No, I bought it on a whim when the opportunity presented itself. A co-worker was selling their car, and it just happened to check all of my boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cheap.</strong> The co-worker only wanted $2,000 for it, even though <a href="https://kbb.com">Kelley Blue Book</a> put it closer to $3,500.</li>
<li><strong>Stick Shift.</strong> I'd always wanted a manual transmission car. I had learned once when I worked at the bus company, but I was never good at it, which I'm going to blame on a lack of practice rather than a lack of ability.</li>
<li><strong>Great Shape.</strong> Despite being 14 years old, the car only had ~86,000 miles on it. Plus, my co-worker was the sole owner of the car for its whole life, and it <strong>wasn't</strong> the car they learned to drive stick on.  They had also meticulously documented (with receipts) all the work they had done to it.</li>
<li><strong>Ugly.</strong> In and of itself, the 2004 Honda Civic is a fine looking car, as far as sedans from the early 2000s go. This particular Honda Civic is a bit&#8230;unsightly. The clear coat is coming off, one of the doors is missing a handle, and the interior is covered in a fine layer of Cheerio dust (my co-worker has two small children).</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of all of those things, the financials happened to line up too. Normally, I don't keep more than $1,000-$2,000 in my checking account, because I invest my paychecks as they come in. I do this explicitly to disincentivize myself from doing exactly what I did. But on this particular week, I happened to have some extra cash in my checking account, preparing for Questionable Purchase #3. <sup>Oooh, foreshadowing!</sup></p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FOHxdlpugXeyEPGKVesGUKhshzuTrzIgV4rnUSiCPIXceKwDK43nX_bKawy_T0UiqqehP7hg2CX2hzViPsQzM8un8AnuMIH8yhV56Q=s600"/>
<p>I took this picture in a Panera parking lot, because I'm a classy lady.</p>
</div>
<p>I haven't yet decided if this purchase is run-of-the-mill dumb, or next-level, pants-on-head dumb, but as a dude who prides himself on keeping things simple, it definitely seems like an indefensible decision. Strap in though, because I'm going to attempt to defend it.</p>
<h2>Deprecating the Truck</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of words saying mean things about the truck: how it's a screaming metal death trap, how it'll explode any day now, how (intentionally) hideous and inhospitable it is, how I spend as much time as a I can away from it, you know the deal. And it's all true, every word of it. I bought the truck for a singular purpose: sleeping.<sup>(and also storing my stuff, but let's not nitpick)</sup></p>
<p>Sure, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/obvious-facts-about-box-trucks-2-theyre-great-for-moving-things/5691726094139392">the truck is great for moving things</a>, but aside from that, I really would prefer to never be driving it, for a whole host of reasons I've <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/getting-around/5686683802533888">rambled</a> <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/parking-perils/5693417237512192">about</a> <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-i-word/5743868070854656">at length</a>. But there really are times when I do need to drive, which I'll enumerate in painstaking detail now.</p>
<h2>Times I've Needed a Car</h2>
<h3>That time the truck battery died</h3>
<p>Okay, so it turns out I could only think of a single situation where I absolutely positively needed a car, and it was the time I accidentally killed by battery. Turns out, if you start a vehicle and immediately turn it off again, the alternator doesn't have time to replace the charge used to turn the engine over. You might do this, for example, if you were just inching forward into a slightly better parking space. Further, if you (unwisely) did this several times over the course of a few weeks, with no other driving in between, that would definitely kill the battery. This is what I did. Don't do it, it's no fun.</p>
<p>But anyway, to get a replacement battery, I had to rent a car, no two ways around it. Lugging a 50 pound battery in and out of a Lyft, while probably hilarious and a fun story, wasn't how I wanted to spend my Saturday.</p>
<h2>Times I've Wanted a Car</h2>
<p>The fact that I could only think of a single occasion where I truly needed a car seems to suggest I really shouldn't have purchased one. But, just for funsies, let's look at all the times I've <em>wanted</em> to have a car.</p>
<h3>That time I went on a date</h3>
<p>Who am I kidding, I don't go on dates.</p>
<p>But in a hypothetical world where I did go on dates, I don't think it'd be unreasonable to want to be able to pick up my date in a vehicle that isn't a five-ton box-house death-machine. Sure, I could just rent a fancy car (on Turo or Getaround) for dates, but that doesn't sound particularly sustainable. Also, I'd like to think my ego isn't actually that fragile.</p>
<h3>Literally any time I've driven the truck and wasn't hauling something</h3>
<p>One of the reasons I decided to live in a truck was because there's so much cool stuff to do in the Bay Area. Why would I want to be at my boring old apartment when I can be out in a world full of new and interesting experiences? Sometimes, those experiences necessitate driving, either because they're too far to bike, or don't align with the public transit schedules. Historically for those cases, I've had <del>three</del> four options, roughly ordered from least terrible to most terrible:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hope someone else can drive.</strong> This requires depending on other people, and means I can't really make the plans, which limits my flexibility. Plus, it means no solo trips, and I quite enjoy my alone time.</li>
<li><strong>Rent a car.</strong> I've done this a couple times, to go to concerts in San Francisco or to go to Monterey, for example. Again though, this isn't particularly sustainable, especially if I want to do it every week or two. Plus, then you have to juggle the logistics of picking up and dropping off the rental car.</li>
<li><strong>Just don't go.</strong> I could always just pass on whatever opportunity has presented itself, but where's the fun in that?</li>
<li><strong>Drive the truck.</strong> Hard pass. Between gas, parking, and tossing my furniture into the air every time I hit a pothole, the truck is by far the worst option.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, none of these are ideal, so having my own dedicated vehicle makes a lot of sense here. Still, I managed to get by three years without one, so I need to make sure I'm using it the right way.</p>
<h2>Ground Rules</h2>
<p>As far as having a car goes, I think the one I got is pretty in-line with the rest of my life. It's in good shape, it's not flashy, it's pretty unsightly, and it's practical. Having a car represents a pretty dramatic shift in the way I can do things, so to make sure I'm using it in a way that's consistent with my own goals, I've set up some pretty basic guidelines.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If I can bike, do it.</strong> <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-series-of-questionable-purchases-1-of-3-a-bike-/5761673931522048">My last major purchase was a bike</a>, and I intentionally got a nice one to disincentivize myself from driving. That way, I'm more likely to bike because I legitimately enjoy it more.</li>
<li><strong>If I can take public transit, do it.</strong> I didn't get a car for convenience, I got it for when it makes sense. If I'm just going to the city for the day, biking + public transit will always be a better and more exciting option.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I'm still getting used to having a car. In particular, now I have to juggle the car and the truck and my bike, and I've actually struggled quite a bit trying to find a reasonable flow that makes all of them accessible when I need them. I'll save those stories for another post though.</p>
<p>As a closing note: I'm frantically finishing this post before I catch a flight to start a ten-day trip in Israel, so the reveal of Questionable Purchase #3 will have to wait until I return.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I'm generally not against spending money. I am however generally against <em>buying things</em>. This is <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-art-of-not-buying-things/5718532058775552">a point I've surely beaten well beyond death</a> by now, so I won't belabor it much further. It's just to say that I want to be really sure something makes sense within the larger context of my life before I buy it and have to deal with it forever.</p>
<p>I only mention this because I've been on a bit of a purchasing spree (by my standards) as of late, which is at least part of the reason I've been so quiet on here for the past two months. The other part of the reason is that I'm just generally bad at blogging. Anyway, this post (and the next two), will talk about some of the purchases I've made, mostly over the past few weeks. This first one's not all that contentious, but I promise they'll get more questionable as we go. Okay, on to the post.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have a fairly limited range of hobbies. I like reading, hiking, writing the occasional blog post , making low-quality gag websites for my own amusement, and last but not least, biking.</p>
<p>My love of biking isn't new, I've definitely mentioned it <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/lean-and-green/5636470266134528">once</a> or <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/leaner-and-greener-2-lean-2-green/5753952654065664">twice</a>. Even though I was a total biking rookie three short years ago, some of my favorite memories since moving out to California have been biking up and down the Bay Trail on my trusty steed, a used Raleigh Misceo I haggled my way into purchasing. Alas, the bike is showing its age and last year was deemed <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/getting-around/5686683802533888">financially unwise to repair</a>.

<p>Nowadays, riding the bike (even at the slowest of speeds on the smoothest and flattest of surfaces) feels like riding an exercise bike covered in molasses, with the resistance cranked up to 11. With my sore, lactic acid-filled quads in mind, I decided that the bike and I would embark on one last hurrah, a figurative ride into the sunset: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bike-to-Work_Day">Bike to Work Day 2018</a>, henceforth just called "BTWD", because bandwidth ain't free. My company is big on BTWD, so I figured I'd Caltrain up to San Francisco and join tons of my SF-based co-workers for the ~42 mile ride to work in the morning.</p>
<p class="text-center">But alas, it wasn't meant to be.</p>
<h2>Tragedy Strikes</h2>
<p>The weekend prior to BTWD, my favorite mode of transportation was stolen from me. Err, the front wheel was stolen while the bike was locked up at a Caltrain station. The back wheel of the bike was also removed, but whoever removed it realized that wasn't even worth stealing, and they left it next to the bike. The rear derailleur was also in rough shape from being on the ground; I don't imagine it was placed particularly gingerly.</p>
<p>I feel a bit guilty for this, but I'd semi-secretly been rooting for it to be stolen, and I was almost happy to find the bike in such a sorry state. After all, it gave me an excuse to jump start my search for a new one. In and of itself, that bothered me a little bit. I guess it's just frustrating how something that means so little to me (a bike tire) can mean so much to someone else, to the point they'd take the risk of stealing it. This is probably a good time to plug <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href="https://handup.org/">HandUp</a>, organizations that give money directly to people in need. If you've ever felt overwhelmed with how lucky you've gotten in life/how good your life is, they're both wonderful organizations to contribute to.</p>
<p>Brief tangent aside, with BTWD right around the corner, it wasn't a great time to have my bike in an unusable state. Luckily for me, my employer provides a borderline sickening bevy of useful perks, one of which is doling out commuter bikes to anyone who wants one. So I borrowed a beat-up commuter bike, and did the ~42 mile ride.</p>
<p>I hadn't done a long (&gt;20 mile) ride in a while, partly because it had been colder than usual and partly because I'd been lazier than usual, but I got to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride from SF down to South Bay. The weather was gorgeous, the ride was the right amount of challenging, and best of all, I got to stuff my unremitting maw with more food than usual.</p>
<h2>Bike 3.0</h2>
<p>Still coming down from my BTWD-induced high, I started my search for a new bike almost immediately. My thought was that, with a few years of bike riding experience under my belt, and plans to do a century (100+ mile bike ride) one of these days, I shouldn't be afraid to spend a bit more on a nice road bike that will likely last me a decade or so with proper care. After doing a bit of research, and learning even the most basic of cycling lingo, I eventually settled on the <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/allez/p/129052?color=239798-129052">entry-level Specialized Allez</a>, coming in at a pricey, (but not bank-breaking) $750. It's got an aluminum frame, carbon fiber fork, Shimano Claris shifters, and many other fancy-sounding features I can vaguely pronounce and even more vaguely understand.</p>
<p>I tried out some of the more premium bike configurations, even testing out a <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/roubaix-elite/p/128886?color=240078-128886">$2,800 Specialized Roubaix Elite</a>. In the end though, I couldn't really justify a bike that is almost four times the cost and only a few pounds lighter and a few percent faster. I used a corporate discount to get 15% off the bike as store credit, which I used to buy a new lock, seat bag, and replacement tube kit. The seat bag and replacement tube kit were promptly stolen two days later while biking around San Francisco. Such is life.</p>

</div>
<h2>Reflecting</h2>
<p>In the context of my life, this purchase probably made sense. Sure, I could have fixed up my old bike, replacing the derailleur and the front tire, but the rest of the bike was in such bad shape that I'd really just  have been prolonging its misery, and my own. Through that lens, treating this purchase like an investment in my cycling-heavy future seems like a reasonable bet. The jury is still out on whether that's true for Questionable Purchases&#8482; 2 and 3.</p>

<p class="text-center">
The future scares me.
</p>
<p>
Not in a <strong>"the icecaps are melting"</strong> sense,<sup>*</sup> more of a <strong>"what am I doing with my life"</strong> sense.
</p>
<p>
I spend <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/decimals-and-dollars-planning-the-next-decade/5669283816275968">a lot of my words</a> on this blog talking about the future. Saving for it. Planning for it. Picking travel destinations.
</p>
<p>
So imagine my surprise when I sat down one day to think about it, and I found that I had no idea what I actually wanted to do with my life.
</p>
<p>
Looking over my past posts, the plan seems pretty clear:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Live in truck.</li>
<li>Save money.</li>
<li>"Retire" young and travel the world.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<p>
A <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-question-of-time/5746311907246080">painfully naive snippet</a> from a year and a half ago captures it really well:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
[My] next home will ideally be nothing more than a backpack. I'll hop around the world as passports and seasons and retirement monies allow, staying in hostels and exploring the places that words in my travel books couldn't possibly do justice.
</blockquote>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Notice anything missing there? Like, for example, literally anyone else in my life. My friends? My family? I didn't leave a ton of room for other permanent human beings in my plans.
</p>
<p>
I don't think I was intentionally being selfish with my plans, I just think I have a tendency to idealize and romanticize, <em>especially</em> when I'm writing for the blog. This blog is focused on a specific (and relatively small) piece of my life, so it paints a skewed picture. I like things to be simple and clean and my ideals reflected that, to a fault. The idea of perpetual travel might make for pithy poetry, but it's not practical.  
</p>
<p>
Do I want to travel? Of course I do. Every opportunity I've had so far has been an absolute blast, and I'm better off for having done each trip. But there need to be limits, there needs to be flexibility. There are big life questions that don't get answered when the plan is just "travel perpetually". Things like, "how do I take care of my aging parents?" or "what if I want to have a family, or kids?"
</p>
<p>
I didn't start thinking about these things until a series of depressing life events (some my fault, others not) made me start to question my own mortality. Sure, in the grand scheme of things I'm pretty young, but I'd be foolish to pretend I'm not getting older. It's been nearly three years since I moved to California, and it almost hurts to think about how fast that time has gone by. One of my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-quest-for-arbitrary-milestones-/5767494685949952">biggest fears</a> was complacently watching my life pass me by. I thought the truck would save me from it, keep me on my toes, but the time passed all the same. Not much has changed in those three years: I've learned a bit, I've earned a bit, and I've been a few places, but I'm fundamentally the same Brandon I was three years ago. Same truck, same routine, different year.
</p>
<p>
So, what do I do now? Well, I try to sort it all out. I sit down in a quiet room and I take a lot of deep breaths. Or I hop on my bike and ride slowly along an empty trail. I go through the same process that led me to buy the truck. I think about what matters to me and who matters to me. I think about where my priorities lie, and what happens when they conflict. I think about the things I think I want, and the things I know I don't.
</p>
<p>
And I realize that I do want to be there for my family, and at some point, I'll have to move somewhere closer to them. I realize that I do want to share my life with someone, and maybe we'll want tiny genetic hybrids running amok someday. I realize that these things don't necessarily fit in with retiring early, and I'm okay with that. It's not a race, and working for a few more years for what I care about isn't a big deal.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
I'm not really sure what the purpose of this post is.
<br/>
Maybe just to un-skew the proverbial picture a little bit.

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>This may not be my first post of 2018 (or even my second, for that matter), but hey, better late than never.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Happy 2018!</strong></p>
<p>I've <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/new-years-resolutions/5722646637445120">said before</a> that I'm not a big fan of New Years' resolutions. That's still true. But I <em>am</em> a fan of taking the time to evaluate how my life is going, and course-correcting as necessary. I try to do it every few months, but the start of a year is as good a time as any to take a good hard look in the mirror, so let's do it.</p>
<h2>Metrics for Success</h2>
<p>I feel like it'd be cheating to just say, "yeah, I think things are going well", and call it a <del>day</del> year. I think it's important to figure out what it means for things to be good, and that's going to be different for everyone. For me, things are good when some combination of the following things (in no particular order) are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm learning new things</li>
<li>I'm lifting heavier objects</li>
<li>I'm closer to financial independence</li>
<li>I'm getting my beauty sleep</li>
<li>My friends and family are doing good, by their own metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>With some criteria in mind, let's break it down and see if things are, indeed, good.</p>
<h3>Learning New Things</h3>
<p>2017 was a good year for learning new things. I learned how to snowboard (badly), do stand-up comedy (poorly), and dance like Beyonc&#233; (abysmally). And no, I will not post videos of me doing any of those things, but here are some pictures (except for the Beyonc&#233; dance class, because I don't need that kind of blackmail material out on the open internet):</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FqCWYlzuw7A7LZibvxK6em5s4d9zCDsbY3J9XYjwhiA0vV6IYKz0hr3Q480qDQfbQDd5hSoHgPtsRW5IvOfl4m6K_3fUA6aY0aG-=s300"/>

<p>Not pictured: (left) me involuntarily headbutting the mountain, and (right) a stone-faced audience cringing in silent, abject horror as I laugh hysterically at my own bad jokes.</p>
</div>
<p>I'm a big fan of doing things ever-so-slightly outside my comfort zone, because I think that's where the real learning and growing happens. And that's pretty much how I ended up in comedy and dance classes, by taking double-dog dares from my friends.</p>
<p>Outside of half-assing new skills, I spent some time full-assing a few existing skills. I bought a Kindle and read more books than in past years, and learned about different areas of computing, like how to correctly use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, properly deploy stuff on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, write games in <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, and build modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single-page applications</a> (which I <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/truck-tech-smarter-search/5712453606309888">mentioned</a> recently). I'm hoping they'll prove useful in future endeavors.</p>
<h3>Lifting Heavier Objects</h3>
<p>In my list above, I said that things are good when I'm lifting heavier objects, but I probably should have phrased it as "I'm lifting heavier objects, and my feet take me farther, faster", but that's a lot of words and it didn't fit the pattern I was going for.</p>
<p>If you search the blog for the word "<a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/search?query=cardio">cardio</a>", pretty much all of the references are talking about how bad I am at it. Growing up, my doctor said I had "sports-induced asthma", which is fancy doctorspeak for saying I was "exceptionally unathletic". I'm happy to report I do <em>real</em> cardio now&#8230;for various values of "real". I ran my first 5k in November, at an 8:25 pace. Yes, I did spend a few minutes at the finish line dry heaving, but we can definitely gloss over that detail.</p>
<p>I don't have any pictures, because the company who did the marathon photos wanted like $20 for a digital download, which is downright thievery. Like, I understand you need to maintain the site and set up the cameras and win contracts, but why on earth would I shell out $20 for a high-resolution print of myself on the verge of tossing my cookies?</p>
<p> As for heavy objects, my ability to <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/picking-things-up-and-putting-them-down/5651874166341632">pick them up and put them down</a> actually declined in 2017. Like, January Brandon would beat December Brandon in a whole gamut of strength-related activities, and probably a fight, if for some reason it came down to that. I cut meat out of my diet early last year, and even though I was being careful with my macronutrients, I still lost somewhere between 15%-20% of my overall strength while my body adjusted (I used to subsist almost exclusively on chicken, for better or worse). I also did a lot of travelling in the first half of the year, which means I wasn't as consistent with my routine. I've gotten most of my strength back, and I'm also a few pounds lighter, so my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilks_Coefficient">Wilks Coefficient</a> has <em>probably</em> improved, but there's still plenty of work to be done if I ever want to hit my combined lift (squat, bench, deadlift) goal of 1,000 pounds.</p>
<h3>Closer To Financial Independence</h3>
<p>One would think that this should be the easiest goal to quantify, since it's inherently numerical. The problem is that I've always struggled to find a good dollar amount for my target "nest egg", the amount of money where I'd feel comfortable quitting my job (if I wanted to). The generic target people throw around is a million dollars, because it's a nice round number, and if you're using a 4% safe withdrawal rate (<a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/q--a-9-mo-money-mo-questions/5706033703944192">discussion</a>), $40k a year is perfectly livable in many parts of the country that aren't San Francisco.</p>
<p>And sure, we can use $1 million for a rough estimate, but at some point I have to answer some real questions to figure out if that's right or not. Questions like, "do I want kids?" and "how does a significant other fit into my life?" have a huge impact on how much money I should set aside, and how large of a safety margin I need. In the past, I've given <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/qa-8-cleaning-out-the-closet/5681097123823616">a non-answer</a> about keeping my finances flexible and doors open, but that's really just a nicely-phrased cop-out. The older I get, the less useful that answer becomes, which is something I learned the hard way unfortunately. I'm sure I'll address it all in a future post, but for now, we'll use $1 million as our target.</p>
<p> When I moved out to California in May 2015, I had $0. And when I say $0, I <em>mean</em> $0. Like, "strategically skipping meals" broke. It was definitely a rough week or two before I had started work and received my first paycheck.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that's all in the past. At the beginning of 2017, I had ~$125,000 invested. At the beginning of 2018 (i.e. two weeks ago), I had ~$314,000 invested. To clarify, this is the balance of my Vanguard accounts, so it includes my 401k, Roth IRA, and brokerage account. It doesn't include checking accounts, my HSA, any assets (not that I have any), or the change in my cupholder.</p>
<p>As far as financial independence goes, those numbers are heading in the right direction. I saved 50% more in 2017 than in the year and a half before. Granted, those savings are on the back of a <strong>very</strong> bullish market, which I don't expect to last forever. It'd be unwise of me to try and extrapolate the next few years based on the strong growth of the previous few years. Still, it's not unreasonable to think I could reach our example target in five more years without any crazy cost-cutting on my part.*</p>

</div>
<p>My biggest expense this year will likely be travel. I don't really travel for work anymore, since I <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-switch-up/5670405876482048">changed jobs</a>. I'm hoping I can pull together a few personal trips this year, and visit some of the places I've been reading about.</p>
<h3>Getting My Beauty Sleep</h3>
<p>I'm a big proponent of sleeping, and sleeping <em>well</em> at that. It's been a while since I've talked about <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/sleep-science/5733935958982656">tracking my sleep quality</a>, but I've still been recording data for the past few years through <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep">the same Android app</a>.</p>
<p>Originally, I wanted to write about how my sleep quality has changed over time. I figured out how to export the data (all ~47,000 data points!), but it's been a massive struggle to parse it into an analyzable format, and then to properly visualize it. Because this post is already almost a month late, I'm going to give up trying to process the data for now.</p>
<p>In short: I have no idea how well I slept in 2017, but I'll do a follow-up post once I figure out how to sift through the data.</p>
<h3>Friends and Family</h3>
<p>Even if everything in my life was moving along swimmingly, it would be a pretty hollow success if my family and friends weren't doing so hot.</p>
<p>Recently, one of my friends was mistaken for someone else at a bar and legitimately attacked by a very belligerent, very drunk woman. He's fine though, and I'm sure it will be a hilarious story at some point in the future, probably after the gash in his face heals up. Freak bar attacks aside, everyone in my life is doing pretty swell, which makes me happy. Don't really think I need to elaborate on this one.</p>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>I don't want this post to be a self-congratulatory shrine to how awesome I think I am. Reading it over though, that's kind of what it's devolved to. Sure, I'm proud of what I accomplished in 2017, but there's still <strong>a lot</strong> of room for improvement.

<p>For starters, I got physically weaker, I dropped the ball on some personal relationships, and (in more ways than one) I wasn't as focused as I want to be. I think it's because I've gotten too used to my routine. It makes sense: I've found a good, consistent routine and <em>I like it</em>. The problem is that I get comfortable with it, which takes the edge off the sense of purpose and urgency that usually motivate me. It's hard to sustain that energy when you're doing the same thing over and over.</p>
<p>And that takes a tangible toll. I've noticed I'm less enthusiastic about my workouts, I'll drag my feet and miss sets or even entire days. My passive attention to personal relationships hasn't been enough to keep them healthy, and I've noticed I oscillated idly between projects, making little progress on any of them. Ironically, it looks a lot like <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-quest-for-arbitrary-milestones-/5767494685949952">the problem I thought the truck would save me from</a>, because I thought the truck was too obnoxious to get comfortable with.</p>
<p>To explain it another way, it feels kind of like that Adam Sandler movie <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389860/">Click</a></em>. For those who (wisely) stay away from Adam Sandler films, the gist is that a dude gets a magical remote, and one of the things it allows him to do is fast-forward through "uninteresting" parts of his life. While he's able to eventually fast-forward to his goal, he spends most of his life on auto-pilot and everything kind of falls apart as a result.</p>
<p>I said that 2017 was about <em>investing</em>, and it was. I invested in myself and the truck, and it's paid off: I'm closer to my financial goals and <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/rain-rain-go-away/5760820306771968">not massively stressed out when it rains.</a></p>
<p>So what's 2018 about then? I'd say <em>finding focus</em> and <em>being present</em>. I've got the routine down and the investments are paying dividends, but I need to get off auto-pilot. I need stay mindful of why I do what I do. I need to be more in the moment. I need to take a more active role in the things I do every day.</p>
<p>But I don't know how to do those things yet. Maybe the solution is to take more deep breaths and dedicate some time each day to just existing. Maybe I'll have to introduce some dynamism into the routine to keep me motivated. I'm not sure. But I know that the work I put in now sets the course for the rest of my life. And if that's not motivation enough, I don't know what is.</p>
<br/>
<p class="text-center">Here's to 2018, and to achieving anything you set out to do, whether it takes a day or fifty years.</p>
<br/>
<p>*<em class="small">One could argue that living in a truck is a "crazy cost-cutting" measure, but at this point it's a pretty foundational part of how I live, and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice. &#175;\_(&#12484;)_/&#175;</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><strong>Obligatory warning: This post is about some of the inner technical workings of the site. If that doesn't tickle your fancy, you might find this unfathomably boring.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, when I've exhausted all other interesting or productive things to do, I'll blow the dust off the code that makes this site hum along, and tweak it in one way or another. I've got to say, it's a pretty thankless task. Brandon in 2015 didn't really know what he was doing when it came to building web services in <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>, so the core codebase has historically been&#8230;unkempt, to say the least. To say the most, it looked like it was haphazardly slapped together by a team of monkeys banging on typewriters in the wee morning hours at the end of a hackathon.</p>
<p>But with a few more years of professional experience working with these tools,
 and a couple late nights <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a> the site into submission, making changes and adding functionality isn't nearly as painful these days. So I decided to sit down and fix one of the weaker parts of the site: the search functionality.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/truck-tech/5721036024709120">talked about my original search implementation</a> before. I was (slightly) young(er) and ambitious, and I wanted to do everything myself (except the frontend, because HTML/CSS/JavaScript are the devil). The search code looked something like this:</p>
<div class="text-center">
<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
<pre class="blog-code">
<code class="golang" style="padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px;">func buildATerribleSearchIndex() map[string]map[int64]bool {
  // Our "search index" is a big map from words to the post IDs that they
  // appear in.
  invIndex := make(map[string]map[int64]bool)

  for _, post := range getAllOfThePublishedPosts() {
    for _, word := range extractAllTheWordsFromThePostButDoItPoorly(post) {
      // If the word isn't in the index yet, make a submap for it.
      if _, ok := invIndex[word]; !ok {
        invIndex[word] = make(map[int64]bool)
      }
      invIndex[word][post.ID] = true
    }
  }

  return invIndex
}
</code>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I removed some of the error-handling for brevity, and made the function names obnoxious because that's who I am, but this is basically what I had. There are a few major problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It's not persisted anywhere.</strong> It's stored in-memory. This was pure laziness on my part, and it means we have to rebuild the index every time our server dies. By virtue of the way <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> manages server instances, it's pretty much guaranteed to kill your server randomly for fun and sport.</li>
<li><strong>We go through allllll the posts</strong>. Now I'm not the most prolific writer, but there are over 100 posts, and some of them are fairly long, and App Engine servers are small (by default), and the parsing/delimiting operation isn't exactly cheap. Reindexing all the posts before a page load was actually noticeably slow, on the order of a second.</li>
<li><strong>Index invalidation is hard.</strong> Say I want to edit a post (because someone points out I've spelled the word "truk" wrong, for example), how do I update this index? Well, I blow it away and start from scratch obviously! Instead of just removing references to the edited post and reindexing that, I reindex all the things. Again, because laziness.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, how do we solve any/all of those problems? Well, we put our huge ego aside and leave searching up to people that know what they're doing, let's say, Google, for example. Sure enough, Google has a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/search/">search API for Go on App Engine</a>, which is exactly what we want. Ripping out my own search code and subbing in calls to Google's API was fairly straightforward, with each post mapping to a unique document.</p>
<p>The result is a faster search system that's easier for me to maintain. The search results are also more accurate, thanks to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/search#Go_Tokenizing_string_fields">Google's smarter tokenization rules</a>. And since I'm not indexing anything crazy large, it's also free for me to run. Definitely a big win for the site.</p>
<p>There was just one little problem left to fix: <mark>keyword highlighting</mark>. When someone searches for something, they're probably interested in finding the text where that keyword occurs. Previously, I had home-rolled a simple (but highly questionable) highlighting system on the backend that would that would find the keyword and wrap it in a <span style="white-space: pre; font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace">&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>. This worked except when your keyword also matched something inside an HTML tag (because I write my posts in normal HTML), at which point it would just unceremoniously clobber the HTML and mangle the search results.</p>
<p>I figured, if I'm putting in the effort to make search better, I might as well make the whole experience actually work. So I sprinkled some <a href="https://markjs.io/">mark.js</a> magic on the search page in the frontend, and all was well with the <del>world</del> end-to-end search experience. Well, except for the fact that the search box got moved into obscurity at the bottom of the page after <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/blog-20/5659118702428160">my last site redesign</a>, but I'll probably fix that in a future update. Until then, feel free to scroll allllll the way to the bottom of the page and give the search functionality a try. As always, email me or <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/faq">drop a comment</a> if you have any problems.</p>
<h2>Next Up</h2>
<p>Like I alluded to in my last post, I spent a lot of time the past few months <del>not writing blog posts</del> building different websites as Christmas presents for my friends and family. This was mostly an excuse to learn how to use <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">modern</a> <a href="https://vuejs.org/">frontend</a> <a href="https://vuematerial.io/">technologies</a> for building responsive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single-page applications</a>, including actual frontend tests and minified/productionized assets. I'm currently in the process of rewriting the blog as two separate pieces: an API server that speaks a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> protocol to serve posts, questions, etc, and a static frontend that makes calls to this API server. If all goes well, nobody will even notice when I roll it out.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p class="text-center">'Tis the season for belated blog posts! Seriously though, I know my posting track record is terrible to begin with, but it's <em>especially</em> terrible November to January&#8230;which I understand is a non-negligible chunk of the year.  If it's any consolation, most of that time goes to building gag websites of questionable utility as gifts for my friends and family, and traveling to and from the east coast to showcase said gifts. Anyway, I'm glad to be back, now let's get to the topic du jour: managing truck expenses.</p>
<br/>
<p>In my experience, the most common reason people consider living in a vehicle is to save money. And I agree that it can be an attractive premise:</p>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>Cut out your largest expense with this one weird <del>truck</del> trick!</strong></em></p>
<p>Housing dominates the the average person's expense list, doubly so for those in high cost-of-living areas. I did a bit of lackadaisical "research", and it looks like the general agreement is that  <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rent-income-golden-rule_us_5706d315e4b0a506064eb434">spending more than 25-30% of your income on rent</a> is "excessive" or "financially unbalanced". But when the <a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2017/11/2/16595172/apartment-rent-report-sf-2017">median cost of a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco is ~$3,500/month</a>, you'd need to make $140,000 a year to <em>only</em> be spending 30% on rent. That's a far cry from the <a href="https://www.point2homes.com/US/Neighborhood/CA/San-Francisco-Demographics.html">actual median of $77,734 a year</a>.*</p>
<p>It's fair to say that if rent is eating 40%+ of your income, you stand to gain a lot from&#8230;well, moving into a car and not paying rent any more. But as a cost-cutting technique, there are certainly some caveats worth considering before making the leap.</p>
<p>Personally, I've lamented that it can be tricky to figure out just how much I'm saving. It's hard to know what costs of living I've avoided by not choosing a certain lifestyle. But the inverse is a bit easier to figure out: I know exactly how much it costs to live the lifestyle I <em>did</em> choose (and continue to choose every day).</p>
<p>The problem is that I'm not always 100% forthright with acknowledging <em>all of</em> those costs. I've certainly made <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/decimals-and-dollars-planning-the-next-decade/5669283816275968">best-effort attempts at tracking expenses down</a>, and I know how much I spend on <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-ugly-truckling/5675267779461120">major repairs</a>, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-8-starting-over/5720605454237696">home improvement projects</a>, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-i-word/5743868070854656">insurance</a>, etc. Even still, I feel like I sweep certain costs under the rug. Costs that are a direct result of the way I live my life, that I ignore for one reason or another.

<p>And that's what this post is for. I'm a big proponent of aligning my spending with my priorities, which only works if I'm honest with myself about what I'm spending my money on, and where my priorities are. Part of the whole <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/17976-if-you-know-the-enemy-and-know-yourself-you-need">"know thy enemy"</a> thing, if you're aware of the costs of your lifestyle, you can work on fixing them.</p>
<p>So I'll spend the rest of this post talking about some of the expenses I've incurred as a direct result of my lifestyle choices, some obvious, others less so. </p>
<h2>Cost Calculus</h2>
<p>I put the vast majority of my purchases on two credit cards: one that gives me 2% cash back on everything, and one that has 5% cash back on categories that change every few months.** This has a few benefits: I get at least a 2% discount on everything I buy, and all of my expenses are available to be imported into finance management software like <a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> or <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">You Need a Budget</a>. Personally, I use Mint, and I'll reference some of my Mint-derived financial figures in analyzing my expenses.</p>
<h3>Eating Out</h3>
<p>Every single month, without fail,  I'm shocked at the balance I've managed to ring up on my two credit cards. Shocked to the point that I'll go through each expense, confirm I recognize it, and manually sum them all up, only to find (to my complete disbelief), that the balance is indeed correct. And without fail, the most common expense is food.</p>
<p>I think the reason it sneaks up on me every month is because I don't eat a lot of fancy food, and I don't even eat out during the week because I can grab meals at work. But it's death by a thousand bite-sized cuts, and eating out for all of my weekend meals adds up, especially because I eat enough to feed a small village. It may only be $15-20 each time, but three or four times a day, two times a week is ~$150/week. And sure enough, Mint independently claims that I spent $7,316 at restaurants in 2017, or ~$140/week.</p>
<br/>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IXJoMKzkcg92GYYLnkUMVF0f62IQyk9l9LDfVvJWBoU_TSCAMKDjHF2y5_DQDq-xBChL95y9UFqVTR67w3iRr8NkAvPsaSkwc60=s550"/>
<p>Of course, not every meal on my credit card is for me and me alone. There are (hopefully at least a few) dates to account for, and large group dinners where I picked up the tab and everyone paid me back after, to make the server's life a little easier. But I'm sure the inverse has happened too, so Mint makes a fine first-order approximation here.</p>
<p>Also, I never configured reasonable budget limits in Mint, so the greenness of that "budget bar" is totally meaningless.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>Again, it's hard to know what my life would be like if I didn't live in a truck, but it's not unreasonable to think I could stock a refrigerator-equipped apartment with a weekend's worth of similarly nutritious food for way less than $140/week.</p>
<p>And another thing: None of this is to say I'm <em>happy</em> with my food spending. To be honest I think that it's actually kind of ridiculous I've let it get so out of hand <sup><sup>and it's extremely <a href="http://mrmoneymustache.com">un-Mustachian</a> too</sup></sup>. I guess my problem is that I just brush off a lot of excessive expenses with, "well, it's cheaper than rent", which is fine to an extent, but it's one of those things that becomes less meaningful every time I say it. I'm very much one for experiences, and I agree that a meal out can be a great experience, but if I'm just looking to nourish myself before starting my day, or while I'm on the go, restauranting is far from the most efficient approach.</p>
<p>To that end, I've switched things up the past month or so. I may have a <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-1-no-food/5643440998055936">"No Food"</a> policy for the truck (for <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/pest-problems/5759778777202688">good reason</a>), and the truck may not be even remotely appropriate for storing food, but I've found that meal-replacement powders fill my weekend needs perfectly. Basically, I store the Not Conspicuously Sized Tub O' Powder&#8482; in my desk, and portion out a weekend's worth of meals in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HQFAU92">airtight containers</a> every Friday night. Then, when I go to the gym on Saturday/Sunday mornings, I bring a shaker bottle and a serving of powder. I keep the other servings in my backpack and prepare them throughout the day.</p>
<p>And for the few weekends I've tried this, it's worked out surprisingly well. I have enough confidence in the containers that I'm not worried about keeping them in the truck for a day or two, and it means I'm spending ~$20 a weekend on food instead of the ~$140 from above. On top of that, it's quicker and likely healthier. That's enough about food though, let's talk (more succinctly) about other truck expenses.</p>
<h3>Garbage Disposal</h3>
<p>I've talked about <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-5-waste-management/5713144022302720">Waste Management</a> before, so I won't spend too much time rehashing it here. The general gist is this: taking things to a landfill is time-consuming, fuel-consuming, decidedly unpleasant, and on top of that, costs actual money. Throwing away mystery bags of garbage (apparently called <a href="http://missiontrail.com/TransferStation/rates.html">"general rubbish"</a>) is actually fairly cheap, you could dump a truckload of hot, steamy trash for less than $50, but there are premium rates for certain things, like mattresses. So the less stuff you buy, the less stuff you have to throw away, the more money you save.</p>
<h3>Repairs and Maintenance</h3>
<p>Cars break, it happens. In my experience, they tend to break more when you live in them. Whether it's accidentally killing the battery by leaving the lights on, general wear and tear, preexisting damage made more noticeable because you live mere inches away from it, or random acts of wrathful intervention by the Automotive Gods, stuff is going to need fixin'. And if you can't live without it, you're going to have to foot the bill to fix it.</p>
<p>Between little "improvements" to the truck (<a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-project-7-let-there-be-light-and-heat-and-stuff/5694639155707904">insulation</a>, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-project-7-let-there-be-light-and-heat-and-stuff/5694639155707904">a sunroof</a>, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/mini-home-improvement-project-2-desiccants/5707274949492736">desiccants</a>, noise-reducing foam, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-8-starting-over/5720605454237696">a raised bed frame</a>, etc), <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-ugly-truckling/5675267779461120">major upgrades/repairs</a>, administrative fees (<a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-i-word/5743868070854656">insurance</a>, registration, parking tickets, my blasted aftermarket catalytic converter), and regular maintenance (flushing fluids, changing tires, replacing filters) I've spent ~$7,500 maintaining my (originally $10,000) truck. It all comes with the territory.</p>
<p>There's no way to spin it: that's a hefty chunk of change. Not to mention the fact that some of those costs are recurring, which can act as a real headwind against any financial goals you're trying to achieve. I've argued before that I'll probably see some sort of return on those repairs when I sell it, but there's no guarantee that'll be the case. The key takeaway here is that the cost of owning a vehicle is far more than the sticker price, doubly so if you live in it. Think carefully about what you need out of a vehicle, and do your research before you make the purchase to help keep this class of costs in check.</p>
<p>For example, since I knew I wanted an easy and secure way to get in and out of the truck, I could have initially purchased a box truck with an interior door, or swing-open doors instead of a roll-up door, which would have saved me money in the long run. Or, for example, if I had known that California only allows a short list of approved catalytic converters, I wouldn't have gotten a truck with a non-approved, aftermarket catalytic converter. These things are certainly easier to recognize in hindsight, but with a bit of proactive research, you can catch them earlier.</p>
<h3>Your Time</h3>
<p>For most of us, time is the most valuable resource we have. And I'll say it outright: <strong>living in a vehicle can be an incredible time-sink</strong>. I'm quick to point out that living near work makes my commute basically non-existent, which is great, but there are tons of activities that get a bit slower because of the truck. Things like laundry and showering require more thought and energy than if I had those resources in my home with me.</p>
<p>Aside from normal every day activities that get a little slower, a lot of those maintenance-related activities I listed above are specific to living in a car. Even for the ones that aren't particularly monetarily expensive, they do require a bit of time.</p>
<p>I like to consider my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Home+Improvement">Home Improvement projects</a> to be great learning experiences, but they also occupy a lot of my time. Figuring out the logistics for getting a bed delivered,
 driving to a suitable place to set up new furniture, measuring/cutting wood and foam paneling for bike racks and insulation, it all takes time. For example, I worked on and off for months before I finished up my insulation project.</p>
<p>I legitimately enjoy working on this stuff, I treat it like an investment in myself. But for people who aren't interested in DIY projects, that could very easily feel like (and indeed, be) a waste of time.</p>
<h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>
<p>Living can be an expensive hobby, but thoughtful tweaks can go a long way towards making some prices more palatable. The best advice I can give to someone living out of a car to save money, or out of necessity is this: plan ahead. Sometimes just sitting down for an hour and thinking about some of your biggest expenses is enough to help reign them in. Recognize what resources you can leverage, and then use them to your advantage whenever possible. To end things on a pithy and faux motivational note:</p>
<p class="text-center">Live simply, live happily, and live with purpose.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I'm doing a bit of sloppy math here, because that $3,500/month in rent is money that's already been taxed, whereas people generally talk about salary in untaxed terms. That means the picture is actually a bit grimmer than I painted it.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">I only use the 5% card for purchases in the currently active category. Neither card has a yearly fee, which is important to me because I'd feel incentivized to spend unnecessarily otherwise. I hope it goes without saying, but I pay the balances in full every month.</em></p>
<p><em class="small">Side note: This post took longer to write than I'd generally like, and that's partly because I bit off a bit more scope than I care to chew. I'll shoot for shorter, more frequent posts as we venture into 2018.</em></p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>While it's not an outright lie to say I have a car, it's probably a bit disingenuous. As <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-switch-up/5670405876482048">recently discussed</a>, calling it a two-seater with some generous trunk space is definitely pushing it (but technically correct).</p>
<p>More accurately, I have an eleven-and-a-half foot tall, four-to-five ton, screaming metal death trap on wheels. From that description (and my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/parking-perils/5693417237512192">past ramblings</a>), it's not particularly shocking that I try not to drive it, but there's actually a whole host of reasons I stay away from behind the wheel.</p>
<h3>So Many Dead Dinosaurs</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 4rem; line-height: 0;">1.</span> The thing is an environmental nightmare, a fact I've <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-i-word/5743868070854656">talked about before</a>. Seriously though, a coral reef dies every time I turn on the ignition. Plus, less driving means I spend less on gas. But even given the utterly dismal ten-mile-per-gallon fuel efficiency, I only ever top the truck off once every three months or so.</p>
<p>Recently, I accidentally killed the battery by sheer force of my own idiocy. After AAA came and jumped it, I had to leave the thing running for a while to make sure the battery was recharged. Watching the monstrous box idle for half an hour was&#8230;painful.</p>
<h3>Keepin' the Rent Low</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 4rem; line-height: 0;">2.</span> Not driving it keeps my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-i-word/5743868070854656">insurance premiums</a> stupidly low for, you know, basically being <em>my rent</em>. The price has gone up and down over the years for a bunch of different reasons (discounts, speeding tickets, proof of mileage, etc), but for now it's settled at a perfectly palatable $492.88 per six month policy.</p>
<h3>Cha-ching</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 4rem; line-height: 0;">3.</span> The less I drive, the more it's worth when I sell it. This isn't a big deal, because with 160,000 miles on it, the additional mileage doesn't really result in much depreciation. I just need to treat it well enough to not cause any major mechanical malfunctions in the mean time.</p>
<h3>"Redecorating"</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 4rem; line-height: 0;">4.</span> Despite my best attempts to secure stuff, things will move around when I drive. The less I drive, the less reorganizing I have to do. Even with earthquake-proofing straps and stuff, there's no telling what kind of torque I'm putting on random key structural components of the truck, and I'd rather not find out by bending something important and suddenly have it start leaking (<a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/rain-rain-go-away/5760820306771968">again</a>).</p>
<br/>
<p class="text-center">So, if I only have one "car", and I do my darnedest to not drive it, how do I get around?</p>
<br/>
<h2>Bikes, Not Boxes</h2>
<p>My trusty partner in crime is a fairly modest machine, the same used road bike I <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/leaner-and-greener-2-lean-2-green/5753952654065664">haggled into my life nearly two years ago</a>. Reading over that post, it's funny to see just how far we (the bike and I) have come. By my estimates, I've put <em>at least</em> 1,500 miles on it, and likely much more. And if the bike was "hardly used" when I bought it, I'd describe it as "well-worn" nowadays. I've definitely put it through its paces, for everything from the daily trip to work (~1 mile), to the weekend jaunt over to one of my usual cafes (~10 miles), to the excursions up to San Francisco/Sausalito I try to make at least once a month (50+ miles).</p>
<p>The last time I brought it in for a tune-up, the mechanic basically told me to not even bother. He said it'd be marginally more to buy a nice road bike than to fix all the thoroughly worn pieces of my current bike. To really drive home his point, he threw in an overly detailed and itemized list of each repair he recommended to bring my bike to a safe and reasonable condition. The list included pretty much every imaginable bike component except the frame.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Exhibit A</strong></p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JSAd94t_YhUq5zZlu4G4ocakeY-jAsPqL-HyQE9zbFiJGWSGl_cuD0icB5namlxQkkhwkvnoCpfqx43TCgw54WBxbOa4-Leh8pTW=s550"/>
<p>And this was nearly six months ago, it's only downhill from here. Which is terrifying, because the brakes don't work all that well.</p>
</div>
<p>With all the above in mind, I'd describe my current plan as "ride it until it literally falls apart from underneath me."</p>
<p>And while I'm fine with that plan, I understand it sounds&#8230;not ideal. I swear, it does have a few redeeming qualities though. For one, I've gotten used to how much effort it takes to get my bike moving, and just how few of the gears still work. So as my bike gets harder and harder to ride, it just means I'll be more and more surprised by how awesome my next bike is. Plus, if this bike can still make it to San Francisco, it can't really be <em>that bad</em>, can it?</p>
<h2>Other Transportation</h2>
<p>But alas, there are times when the bike, try as it may, just doesn't cut it. If I need to show up somewhere not looking like a sweaty, truckly mess, the bike isn't a particularly good candidate. Or if I need to haul stuff around, like picking up a package from my mailbox, the bike is, at best&#8230;awkward. Historically, I've filled in these gaps with corporate cars*, the truck, and the occasional rental car, but these cases come up surprisingly infrequently.</p>
<h3>Renting Cars</h3>
<p>In my past travels, I've always rented cars from the usual suspects, namely National, Enterprise, and Hertz. It makes sense, they're present at all the major airports and I've always gotten generous corporate discounts booking with them, even for personal trips. And while that's all well and good for air travel, I've always been curious if there are better options when I'm just running a lot of errands or doing a semi-local weekend trip. Clearly, I hadn't been curious enough to actually do anything about it, but this past weekend I finally got around to doing a little bit of experimentation.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of living in the Bay Area is that it's a hotbed for random start-ups testing their services out. That may seem like a bit of a non sequitur, but it just so happens that some of these random start-ups operate in the travel/rental car space, like Getaround and Turo. The service they offer is basically like Uber or Lyft, but for crowd-sourced car rentals. People can list their cars at a daily rental rate, and people can go on and rent them.</p>
<p>I had never used either of those services before, but Halloween-related party planning meant I had to do a bit of running around, and the bike wasn't up to task, so I signed up for Turo. There was a bit of a communication/logistics problem with the first car I tried to book, which was unfortunate, but the second one ended up be cheaper, nicer, and closer to where I was, so overall it was definitely a win. And compared with the more traditional options above (even after all my usual discounts), I got a better car, more conveniently, for a better price, meaning these car-sharing apps are definitely going to become a part of my travel playbook.</p>
<p>All of this has gotten me <del>scheming</del> thinking: could I buy a car, and then just list it on one of these sites to make a few bucks on the side? The past two years have shown I only need a car at infrequent and sporadic intervals, so I could heavily subsidize the cost of owning a car (or even profit), with a minimal amount of legwork involved on my end.</p>
<p>I could even take it a step further, and catalog the going rate for rental cars of different makes, models, and years, and compare that to the current cost of buying one of those cars outright. This would tell me which cars would be the most profitable to list on a given platform. Another (related) idea: since these apps allow you to offer car delivery, I could mount a bike rack on the car, drive it to wherever the renter is, and then bike back, and do the same thing in reverse to pick the car up at the end of their rental.</p>
<p>Obviously, I need to look much harder into the details (associated costs, insurance, risks, logistics, etc), but it's certainly an interesting proposition.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I'm all about consistency, particularly when it comes to my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-day-in-the-life-weekday-edition/5645478960037888">daily routine</a>.</p>
<p>To confirm my own biases, I found some research that agrees with the idea that consistency is good. For example, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/70/4/581/647203/Variety-is-the-Spice-of-Life-A-Microlongitudinal">one study</a> suggests that people with regular routines tend to sleep better, and <a href="http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ijo201794a.html">another study</a> of young children found that regular bedtimes contributed to less obesity and better "emotional self-regulation". I generally like the idea of sleeping well, being healthy, and having balanced emotions, so I do my best to be consistent.</p>
<p>At the same time though, I like to keep myself on my toes. I'm always trying to make sure my consistency isn't devolving into some sort of mindless rut. I want to be consistent for the sake of health and happiness, <em>not</em> just because it's what I'm comfortable with. So I try to keep an amicable tension between maintaining a consistent routine, and trying to switch things up. Every so often (usually once every month or two), I'll sit down and take a hard look at my routine, gauge how I feel about different parts of it, and make modifications as necessary. Usually they're pretty small, like going to bed earlier, swapping exercise routines, maintaining a list of books I want to read, or trying to write or bike more frequently. Sometimes, if something really feels amiss, the changes will be a bit bigger. Recently, I decided I wanted a pretty major change.</p>
<h2>Ch-ch-ch-changes <sup><sub>(turn <sup>and <sub>face <sub>the <sub><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl3vxEudif8">strange</a></sub></sub></sub></sup>)</sub></sup></h2>
<p>Two years (and a few months) ago, I started my first day of work at my first post-college job. Not so coincidentally, I slept in the truck <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/surviving-the-first-night/5639274879778816">for the first time</a> that same night. Recently, I left that job for a new one.* I won't really delve into the nitty gritty details of why I left, but I wanted to try something more aligned with my interests, and I had stumbled across a job that fit the bill perfectly.</p>
<p>But what does that actually mean for me? Well, for one, it means I moved to a new office. That's nothing new though. On my last team, I moved with them through four different offices. That's one of the perks of the truck, my commute doesn't change even when I move a city or two over, I just bring my house with me. So this most recent move had very little effect on my routine, and everything else stayed pretty much the same. Changing jobs did present me with a choice I haven't had to think about in a while though.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="text-center"><strong><em>Do I tell my new coworkers that I live in a truck?</em></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The last time I discussed this was <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-4-keep-it-professional/5723151296102400">way back in 2015</a>, and back then I came to the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
These people are colleagues and coworkers first and foremost, I'm interacting with them on a daily basis exchanging ideas and sending code back and forth. For that to work smoothly and efficiently, my workplace peers need to see me as a competent, contributing member of the team who they feel comfortable collaborating with. Being the dude who lives out back like some sort of trailer park reject MacGyver-ing the workplace to suit his needs is not a great way to foster teamwork and cooperation. I'm sure they'd be more than accepting of the situation if I explained it to them; the vast majority of people I talk to about it are very receptive and understanding, but I'd hate for a personal detail to poison any coworker relationships in the event someone didn't approve. 
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, as fate would have it, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-aftermath/5655608640405504">everyone eventually found out anyway</a>. But that was two years ago, and I don't make many media appearances these days, so it stands to reason my new coworkers wouldn't know much of me or my questionable housing choices. I've been working on the new team for about two months now, and as far as I can tell,
 nobody is onto me. Which leads me back to my question: do I tell my new coworkers that I live in a truck?</p>
<p class="text-center">Of course not.</p>
<p>No. Nah. Nope. I 100% do not tell them. I say n-o-t-h-i-n-g. Everything I said in 2015 is still valid: these people are my coworkers, they don't need to be privy to the weirder details of my personal life. That said, I <strong>do</strong> still want to be friendly with them, and topics around housing and commuting <strong>do</strong> still come up, so I have to be prepared for talking about such things. To that end, I've developed a small collection of conversational half-truths for use in these situations:</p>
<div style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;">
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Do you live in the area?</em></p>
<p><em>Totally, I have a small place near campus.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>With roommates, I take it.</em></p>
<p><em>Nope, just a one-bedroom.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Ooh, that sounds pricy.</em></p>
<p><em>You'd be surprised, I get a pretty good deal on rent.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Nice! Must be a short commute.</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, I usually walk or bike in.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Oh cool, so you're really close by.</em></p>
<p><em>I practically live on campus.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>So you don't have a car then?</em></p>
<p><em>Actually, I do. I have a two-seater Ford.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Nothing in that conversation is an <em>outright lie</em>, but it's certainly not entirely truthful. In any case, I'm under no illusion that my co-workers will never find out about my truckliness. I know as time goes on, the likelihood of someone on my team seeing me do some weird, truck-related thing goes way up. And I have no intention of trying to hide it, if people find out, then they find out. I'm proud of the life I'm building for myself. If I was <em>really</em> concerned, I probably wouldn't be maintaining a very public blog. I'm just not trying to evangelize to my coworkers.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I guess technically, I work at a company owned by the same holding company as my previous company, but it's a new project, a new team, and a much smaller company.</em></p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>Don't worry, I didn't get rid of the truck.</strong></p>
<br/>
<p>My home is roughly <a href="https://www.budgettruck.com/trucks-add-ons/truckdetails16foot">16' x 6'</a>, or 96 ft<sup>2</sup>. That makes it a little smaller than your average bedroom. In other words, it's in my best interest to optimize how I use my limited space. Two years ago, I <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-3-consolidation--defragmentation/5704837555552256">talked about</a> consolidating and defragmenting how I laid out my room. The diagram I used looked like this:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_TDqD6dJGUoucczSw9qPmQGS9zhhlUPh4RWD8YNWLdd_ATd02NajVGrSAsKllvCJQpwQ4lDvQio2VNABBVufsrQRFW4LGBJn_WKttw=s500"/>
</div>
<p>By rearranging my things (all three of them), I was able to clear up some space. Not that I actually used that space for anything, it just seemed like a good idea at the time. Though as time went on, my tidy arrangement kinda&#8230;fell apart. I shuffled stuff around <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/obvious-facts-about-box-trucks-2-theyre-great-for-moving-things/5691726094139392">to help people move</a>, I <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/taking-inventory/5701867585667072">threw things away</a>, I loaded and unloaded everything to <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-ugly-truckling/5675267779461120">make room for repairs</a>, and just generally accumulated some cruft along the way. If I were to draw the diagram again as of last week, it'd look like this:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1OOK54aaqBcOFgCmIZuWIwb2u0e_acjhfHxYVqecQM_lpkhp525uV2hE96N1BCxEwmvbzMSom0kTvHygD1r0ymoDsgCuBkqcucbT=s600"/>
</div>
<p>There's still some space, but it's certainly not optimal. Plus, that diagram isn't really telling the whole story. For one, Bed is in pretty rough shape. The springs have lost most of their will to spring, and the box-spring cloth is torn to shreds from being dragged back and forth across the truck half a bajillion times.</p>
<p>And  Dresser&#8230;well Dresser has seen better days. Dresser took a tumble or two on some particularly tight turns, which ripped out my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/mini-home-improvement-1-arts-and-crafts/5730192894984192">arts and crafts straps</a>. Those straps, I might add, had already been shoddily replaced a few times. Adding insult to Dresser's mortal injury, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/rain-rain-go-away/5760820306771968">previous water damage</a> meant that I had to rip out most of the back paneling, making Dresser pretty wobbly. I had attempted to brace it with a spare 2x4, but even that was starting to give way.</p>
<p class="text-center">Unsurprisingly, Ikea furniture was not meant for the trials and tribulations of truck life.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LSW6l1o7XmGnCktOpSU1dlmsjUFuNlsjZs9GICYPBI2SIZpUA6RMpSpt_8iONsumCEoyRKymyZTUQPUo5mYVB2QgVJeR4nM8mOQp=s450"/>

<p>Dresser was coming apart at every possible seam. The last picture was taken mere minutes before Dresser met its timely death.</p>
</div>
<p>And the cherry on my sad truck sundae: the cruft and clutter. I had a big box full of Random Stuff&#8482;: bike parts, unsorted Christmas gifts, a Motorcycle helmet, cleaning supplies, a pile of insurance and stock documents, and god knows what else. And my shoes had clearly been wandering, evenly distributing themselves around the remaining space.</p>
<p class="text-center">Even still, it's not <em>really</em> that bad. At the end of the day, it's still perfectly livable.*</p>
<p>I think at the heart of it, I just enjoy being organized. It's probably a control thing. If my home is organized and clean, I feel like I generally have my affairs in order. Conversely, when the truck looks like a bomb went off in a shared Home Depot/Goodwill dumpster, I feel unprepared.</p>
<p>It's also about keeping up some semblance of appearances. I'm living in a truck, I need to do <em>something</em> to make it look like I have my life together. It's why I try to <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-4-keep-it-professional/5723151296102400">wear halfway decent dress shirts</a> to work, and (attempt to) maintain this blog. I can't live in a truck <em>and</em> have it look like a war zone. I made a helpful chart to illustrate my point:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YvNLQIjX-XsLrIe1p-vp5ZzL1z-Vlu68Zo30qRBhTeYuwNjS_brU-xkDUdlEFJaUhoLo19zqRZPWqVuLr4zAfAFgO1PQWHlvoqFF=s500"/>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>Given the irrefutable evidence of the above chart, it goes without saying that something had to change. So I formulated a plan, and last weekend, I threw away all two pieces of furniture I owned.</p>
<h2>The Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Buy things</strong> - I can't just throw away all my stuff and live in an empty truck. That's a bit hardcore for my tastes. I have to find suitable replacement things first. I tried to stick to my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-art-of-not-buying-things/5718532058775552">general purchasing strategy</a>: Think about what I <em>truly</em> need, and then make a careful purchase of some high-quality, long-lasting items that satisfy those needs.</li>
<li><strong>Assemble things</strong> - If you want something done right, do it yourself. Plus, it's cheaper to buy things unassembled. And some pre-built things are harder to get delivered. And you usually learn some stuff in the assembly process.</li>
<li><strong>Throw out things</strong> - Complete the catharsis. Kick the old stuff to the curb. If it makes sense to donate it, do that instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Straight-forward enough. But, as always, the truck throws some interesting wrenches in the mix. Where do I get large things delivered? Where do I assemble these things? Do I have enough room for both the old things <strong>and</strong> the new things? How/Where do I even get rid of the old things? I started by buying things.</p>
<h3>Buying Things</h3>
<p>I went in with a clear idea of what I needed: a bed and a dresser. Nothing more, nothing less. I kept an eye open for ways to make better use of the limited space, and let that inform my purchases. I started with the bed. I knew I couldn't have a mattress professionally delivered to me, I don't have a "real" address, and I don't think they'd appreciate me giving them some random GPS coordinates corresponding to a parking lot somewhere in South Bay. So my options were either 1) shop online and have it delivered to my mailbox, or 2) pick one up in a store. Both options were fine, but after a bit of research it looks like you pay a pretty hefty markup for shopping at a brick and mortar store. Unless I wanted to spend several thousand extra dollars for fun, my choice was pretty much made for me.</p>
<p>I started researching and comparing online brands. I'm not going to link to them because I'm lazy, but I was looking at Purple, Casper, Tuft and Needle, Leesa, Amerisleep, and a few others. After a week of reading reviews and comparisons, I had narrowed it down to Casper and Leesa, based mainly on price and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound">volatile organic compound</a> (VOC) levels. Price is a pretty normal metric to use. As for VOCs, I figured the mattress would be in a much smaller area than the manufacturer intended, with less air circulation. I don't want to saturate my limited air supply with irritants and sadness. In the end though, it came down to which one was cheaper after all applicable discounts, and Leesa came in at a riveting $6 cheaper. Not much of a difference, but fine as a tie-breaker.</p>
<p>Historically, my feet always flirted with the edge of the bed, so I ordered a Twin XL to replace my Twin. This meant I couldn't really reuse my tattered box-spring, even if I wanted to. I found a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017YETIO8">tall mattress base</a> that looked good, and had the added bonus of giving me some under-bed storage space. I picked up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016P42ARU">new sheets</a> and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EINBSEW">memory-foam pillow</a> for completeness.</p>
<p>To avoid annoying my postmaster with a 4 foot tall, 50+ pound package lingering around his shipping center, I picked it up within an hour or so of it being dropped off (according to shipment tracking). I did the same thing with the mattress base and the barrage of other packages. If there's any one single person I want to stay on good terms with, it's the dude who has complete control over my address and mail situation.</p>
<p>As for the dresser, I had failed pretty miserably with trying to make my own strap securements for the drawers, so I wanted something with a built-in locking mechanism. I guess I played it pretty fast and loose with my requirements, because I ended up getting a <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-72-in-H-x-36-in-W-x-19-in-D-Welded-Steel-Garage-Floor-Cabinet-in-Black-OA3F361872-09L/300330898">six-foot tall, welded steel garage storage unit</a>, which I wouldn't really consider a "dresser".</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BFyDKQtRGXL56RSbluVKr_4dgXI6JumLpzdtyCCFbKtFHJUkVGixGzZj_SJeOAZr0t0QMUp3XPHCSpRVcbaFRGMK3HM6_Ef_xB8=s600"/>
<p>28.5 ft<sup>3</sup> of raw, storage-y goodness.</p>
</div>
<p>While unorthodox, this has a number of benefits over any dresser-based solution. For one, this thing is <em>huge</em>. Volume-wise, it's probably twice the size of the dresser I tossed out. That means I can fit all my clothes, and any remaining Random Stuff&#8482; worth keeping. It's also made of steel, so it's more sturdy and durable than any wooden furniture I could have picked up. Even though I don't have any more water/leak problems, it's still nice to have something a bit more resilient to such things. Best of all, this thing <strong>locks</strong>, which means the doors won't be opening while I'm driving (provided I remember to lock it). It's also more secure, not that I'm worried about people stealing from me.**</p>
<p>Instead of having the 150+ pound unassembled cabinet shipped to me, I went to a local Home Depot to pick it up. Unluckily for me, the first Home Depot I went to didn't have it in stock, which was entirely my fault because I didn't check their handy online inventory system. Luckily for me, not only did the second Home Depot have them in stock, they had a display unit that I could look at beforehand to help figure out how I wanted to organize and store things.</p>
<h3>Assembling Things</h3>
<p>At this point, my truck has my old bed and box-spring, my new bed (in a box) my new bed frame (in a box), sheets, pillows, and an unassembled ginormous storage cabinet. It's getting pretty crowded in there. So right after I bought the cabinet, on a sweltering Saturday morning, I plunked the truck down in an unassuming, low-traffic part of the Home Depot parking lot and got to work.</p>
<p>I should note that, for better or worse, this isn't my first time assembling things in a Home Depot parking lot. I had done something similar for the Ikea dresser I was now replacing. Not that that makes it any less weird, but it ends up working out pretty well. For one, I'm <em>always</em> missing some tool or piece of hardware, but I never realize it until the assembly process is well underway. It's obscenely convenient to take a 30 second walk and go pick up the part I'm missing.</p>
<p>Case in point: I made nine independent trips into Home Depot that fateful day. The first one was when Home Depot that told me <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-our-princess-is-in-another-castle">my storage unit was in another castle</a>, but the other eight trips were picking up drill bits, repeatedly buying ill-fitting screws of different sizes, remembering I needed caulking, returning the drill bits I didn't need, buying plastic bins&#8212;you get the idea.</p>
<p>Assembling the bed was a breeze. Modern memory-foam mattresses come vacuum-sealed, setting them up is just unrolling them and gingerly evicerating the plastic casing. Bed frame assembly amounted to unfolding it and tightening four wing nuts.</p>
<p>Assembling the storage cabinet was harder, but still straight-forward. It required ~80 screws, which I lovingly hand-tightened with a small, provided hex key before realizing the <em>other</em> doodad in the box was a hex insert drill bit that would have made my work 1,000x more efficient. Such is life.</p>
<h3>Throwing Things Out</h3>
<p>Post-assembly, the truck was in far and away the most disheveled state it has ever been in. Sure, I had a bunch of shiny new furniture, but I also had all of my old furniture, plus a small mountain of garbage packing materials. On top of that, I had gone through all of my Random Stuff&#8482; and tossed out everything I didn't need, like old building supplies, unnecessary documents, and parts of my now-defunct bike rack.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eSEeY18F1haw8oGd3Bc2DEYpYsaZzkPHNsiclk5D0deT8DkTx5J0AuHDWK3pwbIjXSjwZwZaS_QCDcA1_2N-bxKkBzQQYgANPcnL=s400"/>

<p>The truck was looking extra chaotic during (and after) assembly. At one point, large steel panels covered pretty much every available surface.</p>
</div>
<p>Which leads me to my previously posed question, where do I put all this trash? Conveniently, there's a <a href="http://www.missiontrail.com/">public landfill in Santa Clara</a>. It also happens to be a stone's throw from Home Depot&#8230;just not the Home Depot I had been assembling things at. Anyway, this landfill has a bunch of different rates depending on what you're dumping and whether or not you're a resident. Since my mailbox is in Santa Clara and that's what's on my license, I get the discounted 'resident' rate. I feel morally ambiguous about this, but not enough to actually stop me from continuing to use it.</p>
<p>The way the process works, they weigh your truck on the way in, and they weigh it on the way out. You're charged based on the difference, at a <a href="http://missiontrail.com/TransferStation/rates.html">"general rubbish" rate</a> of ~$20/yd<sup>3</sup> for "residents", which usually means I pay like $10 to toss all my junk. Those units are kind of strange though. Cubic yards? That's a measure of volume, but they're charging based on truck weight, which means that they must have some idea of "average garbage density." I haven't the slightest idea what that would be, but I also don't care enough to try and calculate it from my receipt.</p>
<p>Tragically, I didn't get my rate of $20/yd<sup>3</sup> though. This time, when I showed up, they asked me to open the back, which was definitely a first for me. The garbage was obscuring most of my actual living setup, so it probably wasn't immediately obvious that I live in there. Not that they would have cared, but I was there to clean out my closet, not to explain the skeletons in there. The only comment they had was that the two mattresses (old mattress and old box-spring) would cost $50 a piece to toss, which is at least 20x the normal rate for their weight. Not sure why this is the case, some sort of premium for not trying to sell them on Craigslist or something? Who knows. I paid my $108 and was on my way.</p>
<h2>Good as New</h2>
<p>When I got back to my usual stomping grounds, I did a quick sweep and tied up some loose ends, like finishing up some organizational matters and securing the cabinet to the wall. The black finish is so darn reflective it's hard to get a good picture:</p>

<p>Everything I own either fits in the cabinet or, for some of the larger things, under my bed.</p>
</div>
<p>Tallying up the cost of this home improvement project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sheets and Pillows: <strong>$79.54</strong></li>
<li>Bed frame: <strong>$84.99</strong></li>
<li>Garbage disposal: <strong>$108</strong></li>
<li>Cabinet and accessories: <strong>$412</strong></li>
<li>Memory-foam Mattress: <strong>$583</strong></li>
<li>Not living in a disorganized truck dumpster: <strong>Priceless</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>*<em class="small">Naturally, this will depend on your definition of livable. The truck still doesn't have plumbing or electricity or anything normal like that.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">I'm always saying that if someone robbed the truck, they'd basically just be cleaning for me.</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<div class="text-center">In the winter, I get questions about how I deal with the cold.</div>
<p class="text-center">In the summer, I get questions about how I deal with the heat.</p>
<p class="text-center">Being the more agreeable seasons, spring and fall are generally less concerning to people.</p>
<p>I've talked about <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/winter-is-coming/5158086071287808">dealing with the cold</a> already. Just throw on a few of your favorite layers and cozy up with a comfy blanket. But winter is <em>so</em> last season. With Bay Area temperatures occasionally reaching triple digits, it's as good a time as any to talk about dealing with summer.</p>
<p>Normally, when trucks and temperature come up in casual conversation, I'll say something about how the Bay Area is <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-perfect-storm/5738600293466112">one of the most temperate places</a> around, and that's enough of an explanation for most people. But if we're being honest with ourselves here, it certainly has the potential to get a bit&#8230;<em>uncomfortable</em> in summertime Boxland.

<p>And it's true, the truck is an absolute oven in the summer. If it's parked in direct sunlight, the temperatures in the box can reach nearly 150&#176; F.</p>
<p><strong><em>That sounds, uh&#8230;toasty?</em></strong></p>
<p>Most definitely, especially if you're one of those people who doesn't like being baked alive in their home. I happen to be one of those people, so this would absolutely be a problem if I spent any time in the truck. Thankfully, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/i-dont-live-in-a-truck/5765785288966144">I don't</a>. As I've undoubtedly belabored, I'm only in the truck from around <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-day-in-the-life-weekday-edition/5645478960037888">9 PM until 6 AM</a>. Even on weekends, I'm not generally one for sleeping in past 9 AM or so. I'm out of the oven before it heats up, and back in the oven after it's cooled down. And that's worked well for me for the past two years, enough time to try each season twice over.</p>
<h2>Beating the Heat</h2>
<p>So I survive the truck heat by&#8230;well, just leaving, but obviously my possessions can't do the same. They just have to sit in there and take the heat, for better or, more likely, worse. I figured it wouldn't hurt to do some due diligence and think about the kind of problems I could run into with a hella hot home. So that's what I'm going to do, think about the stuff I have and how the heat could cause any problems.</p>
<h3>Bed</h3>
<p>Aside from the truck, my bed is the largest thing I own. It's also one of the cheapest. It's your run-of-the-mill, twin-sized, coil spring mattress that I picked up for $99 (box spring included) out of a shady back road storefront somewhere in East Bay. The heat doesn't really affect it as far as I can tell, but it is starting to sag in the middle, so I'll be replacing it soon. And that's what makes this kind of interesting. A coil spring mattress might be fine, but if I want to replace it with a <em>real</em> bed made for people who value their sleep, I might be considering a nice memory foam mattress.</p>
<p>Does excessive heat ruin memory foam mattresses? The hell if I know. It's also extremely hard to search The Internet&#8482; for answers, because when you type "<em>memory foam heat</em>", all of the results are about how memory foam beds <em>feel</em> warmer than other types of beds. Also, normal, high-functioning members of society generally don't worry about their home being 150&#176; F and destroying their belongings, so there's not exactly demand for this type of information.</p>
<p>The closest thing I could find when searching around is people asking if it's safe to use a heating pad on a memory foam mattress, and the results were mixed. Some sources were saying it can degrade the mattress, others were saying the heat will just temporary reduce the elasticity of the foam, which is how memory foam mattresses work in the first place. In any case, any self-respecting mattress brand will have a 5-10 year warranty. If there was a problem, it'd likely be covered; I can't really imagine they'd realize I've been slow cooking their mattress in a truck-shaped oven for months at a time.</p>
<h3>Dresser</h3>
<p>It's made of wood, it'll be fine.</p>
<p>Though there is something to be said for the contents of the dresser. Clothes will also survive in the heat, but my entire bottom drawer is filled with all manner of tools, hardware, and sometimes, even a random assortment of chemicals. Here's what the bottom drawer looked like, circa 2015:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fp1j5y6SfdNoFz1biDUKZOGVNzDDizOkQUyiVpPEDAxQowJn6uyrdeQd3CDVgeOypKyPTpUbFQRpKk8zCGhLGOh8yKzRMR5ednGU=s500"/>
<p>Rope, latex gloves, disinfectant wipes &#8212; definitely not a serial killer.</p>
</div>
<p>This was when I was preparing to <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-project-6-fixing-the-hole/5740423507083264">fix "The Hole"</a>, so I had fiberglass resin and a few other heavy-duty chemicals rolling around in there. And a few months after all the hole-fixing shenanigans were done with, summer came around and a distinctly chemical-y smell permeated the truck on the warmer days. Rather than get secondhand contact high on a cocktail of vaporized paint thinners and resins, I tossed all that stuff out, and that solved that problem. I've been more leery about storing any chemicals in the truck now, especially anything pressurized. When in doubt, check the warning labels. If still in doubt, throw it out.</p>
<h3>Laptop</h3>
<p>Aside from my bed and dresser, the only thing of consequence I own is my laptop. It's normally with me, meaning it's normally not in the truck, but on rare occasions I'll leave it in there for a day or two. While it hasn't been a problem so far,
 I was still curious. So I looked up the <a href="http://www.ipearl-inc.com/dell-xps15/xps-15-9550-laptop_Reference%20Guide_en-us.pdf">spec sheet</a> for my laptop, a Dell XPS 15 9550, and it does indeed list a storage temperature of 149&#176; F, which is just shy of my roughly guesstimated 150&#176; F truck temp. Given that I haven't had any problems yet, I'm inclined to believe it's fine. Plus, <strong>processors in modern computers have a <a href="http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=1762.php">higher power density</a> than a nuclear reactor</strong>, which I put in bold because it still blows my mind even after every single engineering professor I had in college would mention it on the first day of class.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mzHBATBvz2NNgM6Mn-qy1Az6AoGQLDFsyFNjavHv7WvVKCX3ZG_CuSPAZwdbGYNt4JoAbhNHf735yupeDpdhho-GNDBBMAsKO1DA=s500"/>
<p>I swear, some variation of this graph was in the introductory slides of every electrical and computer engineering class I took. From <a href="https://semiengineering.com/favorite-forecast-fallacies/">Semiconductor Engineering</a></p>
</div>
<p>If my CPU can push more power per square centimeter than a nuclear reactor <em>and</em> handle it effortlessly,
 I'm inclined to believe leaving it in the truck for a few days is just fine.</p>
<h3>Food?</h3>
<div class="text-center"><strong>Rule #1</strong> of Truck Club: We don't talk about Truck Club.</div>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Rule #2</strong> of Truck Club: <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-1-no-food/5643440998055936">No Food.</a></p>
<h3>Everything Else</h3>
<p>And that's really it. The only things unaccounted for are small things like shoes and backpacks. I guess the only other place I've noticed the heat is on <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-project-7-let-there-be-light-and-heat-and-stuff/5694639155707904">the insulation I put in last year</a>, because the tape I used in between EPS foam panels will occasionally peel back around the edges. Not a big deal, but not something I thought about at the time.</p>
<p>Like I said, by the time I get back to the truck, it's normally 9 PM or so. Even on the hottest days, it's still perfectly manageable by then, and the sunroof is great for letting any extra heat escape quickly. Maybe it's just because I grew up in a place with actual seasons, but the truck life is perfectly palatable year-round here in the Bay. I can confidently say that if I ever do <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-question-of-time/5746311907246080">call it quits</a>, it won't be the weather that does me in.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I knew embarrassingly little about The Box&#8482; when I bought it. I spent weeks obsessing over what <em>kind</em> of vehicle I wanted, but I purchased my current home of two years after only an hour or so of looking it over.</p>
<p>For example: I had the truck for nearly a month before I figured out it used to be a moving truck. More specifically, it used to be a Budget truck, and I just had no idea. I only found out by chance observation; if you look <em>closely</em>, you can still see the faded "Budget" logo, forever etched into the truck. Let me show you, with the help of my good friend <strong>science</strong>:</p>
<br/>
<div class="inline-image">
<p>We start with a picture of the truck.</p>

<p><strong>Boom.</strong> It appears to be the Budget logo.</p>
</div>
<p>Science aside, this isn't particularly shocking: most <a href="https://www.uhaul.com/TruckSales/">truck</a> <a href="https://www.budgettruck.com/buytrucks">rental</a> <a href="https://www.penskeusedtrucks.com/">companies</a>  sell their moving trucks once they're done with them. Mine just went through a few more hands before it got to me.</p>
<p>I swear I have a reason for dredging up the truck's humble, Budget-y origins once again. The truck and I have helped heft, hoist, and haul people's junk around on no less than <strong>ten</strong> separate occasions. For somewhat obvious reasons, <em>I</em> haven't had to move at all since I relocated to California. I mean, I guess it depends on how you think about it. Sure, I've never had to pick up my stuff and move it to a new place, but every time I go get gas I'm hauling all of my belongings with me. Home <em>is</em> where I park it, after all.</p>
<p>On to the part I want to talk about: for at least seven or eight of those moves, I actually <em>offered</em> to help schlep stuff around. No prompting or anything. They mention they're moving, I offer my truck and services. As weird as it sounds, I legitimately <em>enjoy</em> helping people move, and that's what I'll spend the rest of this post discussing (both for my own bemusement and to try and indoctrinate you, dear reader, to do the same).</p>
<h2>Good Exercise</h2>
<p>This one's probably the most obvious. Moving is a great way to put all of those <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/picking-things-up-and-putting-them-down/5651874166341632">squats and deadlifts</a> to good use. Lifting from your legs, maintaining a neutral lower back, keeping your core tight &#8212; all just as applicable for moving as they are for lifting. The more stuff someone has to move, the more intense and effective your workout gets. And this isn't your Dad's workout, it's much more dynamic than any boring old routine you can do in the gym. It's a full-on functional workout. It'll hit your posterior chain like a freight train. Worried you aren't working your stabilizer muscles enough? Carry a bunch of rickety furniture down a few flights of stairs and you'll be sore in muscles you didn't know you had. The muscular pump you get after a few hours of moving Ikea sofas around is a reward all its own.</p>
<h2>Smug Self-Satisfaction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wow, I have a lot of stuff.</em></p>
<p>-Pretty much everyone I've helped move, ever</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear some variation of the above quote, without fail, every time I help someone move. And it makes sense, right? You never really acknowledge how much stuff you have until you have to shuffle it through a labyrinth of hallways and elevators. Step by sweaty step. Box by bloody box. Taking part in that experience is another one of the benefits for me, because it reminds me how glad I am to have so little. I love that I don't have box after box of who-knows-what packed away in my garage, because I don't <em>need</em> those things <sup>and I don't have a garage</sup>. It's kind of like my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-couch-conundrum/5684049913839616">Couch Conundrum</a>, just because I can have something doesn't mean I should. So I end up feeling more grateful for just how good and easy my life is after each move.</p>
<h2>Being a Decent Person</h2>
<p>Moving is one of those activities that people seem to legitimately dread. Maybe it's the prospect of attempting to tame and pack the always-growing piles of dusty knickknacks. Maybe it's the fear of trying to pick up the old bulky television that hasn't been moved since the Reagan administration. Maybe they just aren't looking forward to shelling out money for a truck or professional movers. For one reason or another, most people aren't overjoyed at the idea of hauling all their belongings from Point A to Point B. So if a someone mentions they're moving sometime in the future, offering your services might relieve a bit of their moving-related stress. In my experience, people seem to genuinely appreciate it. Helping people move has turned a few coworkers and "friends of friends" into friends &#8212; the bond created by a formidable move is not soon broken.</p>
<h2>Free Food</h2>
<p>You know what's really satisfying after a few hours of moving heavy stuff around? A hearty meal.</p>
<p>You know what's even better than that? Not having to pay for it.</p>
<p>While I'll always outright decline payment for helping people move, I'll gladly accept a post-move meal. Post-move meals are among the greatest small pleasures one can experience in life. Think about it: you're hungry, you're sweaty, you're sore, what could be a more perfect remedy than free, delicious food with friends? Food is good, the satisfaction of a job well done is good, and combining those is just the bee's knees.</p>
<h2>The Way It Was Meant To Be</h2>
<p>Plainly and simply: hauling crap around is the truck's <del>God-intended</del> manufacturer-intended purpose. The truck was made to roam the open highways, full of useless garbage packed into equally useless plastic bins, and it just wouldn't be right of me to deprive it of that joy. This magnificent piece of machinery was meant to meander down microscopic suburban side streets, narrowly dodging low-hanging branches and awkwardly parked minivans. And who am I to deny the truck its <del>God-given</del> manufacturer-given destiny?</p>
<h2>Really Bad Jokes</h2>
<p>If nothing else, I get to make the same terrible dad joke every time I help someone move. As we pack their boxes and floor lamps and TVs into the truck, alongside my bed and dresser, I'll say something stupid like, "Looks like we're moving in together, I didn't realize it would get this serious so quickly." And they'll chuckle halfheartedly, quietly wondering why they didn't just hire a professional mover.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>If this is your first time visiting the blog (or you use an RSS reader), this post won't really make a ton of sense. But the veteran Box Truck Buffs might notice that the site looks quite a bit different today. For reference, the old site:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bcu0Ze5U2GF4PdIRM0r5MWZSjPuH55siACJrZ-Ab4JMq8jV3iNF7XDjBkFqGGAPL1cdylSyH0yjtDH_sofsAZ_rEs8cF4hcJmZHeQ=s400"/>
<p>The old layout, in all of its Bootstrap-laden goodness. May it rest in sweet responsive peace.</p>
</div>
<p>With the truck <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-ugly-truckling/5675267779461120">getting a makeover</a>, I figured it was just about time the blog did the same. Over the past few months, I've been working on the redesign haphazardly and in random bursts whenever the mood strikes me, and I think it's ready (or close enough) for prime time. But why even redesign the blog in the first place?</p>
<h2>In the Beginning</h2>
<p>When I first "designed" the blog, I had just moved out to California and was juggling buying the truck, getting all my paperwork in order, starting a new job, and a bunch of other random things. With all that on my plate, I didn't have a ton of time to spend on building the blog. And since I hate CSS with a fiery, burning passion, I spent the vast majority of my time working on the backend. What all of this meant is that I basically slapped some Bootstrap on the frontend and <del>stole</del> <em>utilized</em> the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/">Bootstrap blog template</a>, more or less unaltered. Aside from a few <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/new-site-features/5766466041282560">minor tweaks</a> and <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/new-site-feature-savings-clock/5764640680181760">additions</a> over the past two years, the layout of the blog hadn't changed all that much.</p>
<p>But it always kind of bothered me just how bland and uninteresting the blog looked. And at the risk of sounding like a self-involved faux-philosophical starving artist-type, I wanted the blog to look more like a reflection of my own ideals, mainly simplicity and minimalism. Not that the previous design was particularly ornate, but it didn't look anything like it would have if I'd made it from scratch.</p>
<h2>Making it from Scratch</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was delete the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript, which are over-engineered for my needs anyway. Then I spent a few months attempting to do and redo the site in <a href="http://bulma.io/">a</a> <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">variety</a> <a href="https://getmdl.io/">of</a> <a href="https://siimple.juanes.xyz/">CSS</a> <a href="https://getuikit.com/">frameworks</a>. It turns out there are quite a few to choose from, each with their own set of features, benefits, and drawbacks. Personally, I just wanted something basic: a CSS Reset, a grid, and maybe some consistent form and button stylings. Eventually, I settled on <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>, which was pretty simple and straight-forward. I didn't realize that it <a href="https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/commits/master">hadn't been updated since 2014</a> until I was already in too deep. Oh well.
 The world of frontend development moves nauseatingly fast.</p>
<h2>What Actually Changed?</h2>
<h3>Death of the Savings Clock</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/new-site-feature-savings-clock/5764640680181760">Savings Clock</a> was one of the first things I added to the site. It served as a symbol for my progress, and gave me some <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-quest-for-arbitrary-milestones-/5767494685949952">fun milestones</a>
 to watch for. It did a good job of showcasing how ridiculous rent prices in the Bay can be &#8212; for example, I had saved more than <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/indebted/5690820929781760">the total cost of my student loans</a> after only a year.</p>
<p>But it had some problems too. For one, it wasn't accurate, and it never could be. There are just too many dynamic factors to consider (rent price, insurance costs, depreciation, etc), so the numbers mean less and less over time. On top of that, having a savings clock doesn't send the message I'm trying to get across. An always-ticking money counter on the side of the blog says, "Hey, I'm forcing myself to live in a truck because I'm some sort of Mega Scrooge&#8482;, look at the fruits of my unrivaled cheapness and mental instability." As I've surely beat to death in other posts, that's not what this is about.</p>
<p>Anyway, as a part of the redesign, the savings clock has kicked the <sup>(Bit)</sup>bucket. It served its purpose admirably, but its days of countin' are done.</p>
<h3>"About Me" Page</h3>
<p>As it turns out, I'd never actually explained anything about who I am, except in little random tidbits disbursed across a hundred or so posts. Not very accessible. I figured a brief intro wouldn't hurt, so, it's hiding under the "About" section at the top.</p>
<h3>"Ask A Question" Page</h3>
<p>I've long had a place for people to ask questions, which is great. But I get the same set of ~10 or so questions over and over again, which is less great. So I added a short FAQ with answers to a few of those common questions, and strategically moved the question box over there. If I'm lucky, maybe people will stop asking "Where do you go to the bathroom?" with the same frequency I actually go to the bathroom.</p>
<h3>The Little Things</h3>
<p>While Bootstrap is built to be responsive, I hadn't done anything special for the mobile-version of the site before. This time around, I made sure I was paying attention to all of the little stuff that gets annoying on mobile. Hopefully this new site makes good use of screen real estate on mobile, without being too crowded.</p>
<p>A small feature people had asked for was the ability to view higher-resolution versions of inline images in posts. Now, you can click on images to "zoom" in, though I make no guarantees on how well this actually works.</p>
<h2>What's Next</h2>
<h3>Webpack</h3>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/48UKVIAFKNpTQT0Tah1CgQV0PjsYXyZOypCkN8wYwH5Vp2_0egnssIV7mV55IqbQAICFBDHMzhV2zTFQ_4tTdac8mRsOc00ngAljJA=s250"/>
<p>Not only is Webpack a useful tool, it has a cool and trendy logo, too.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a> is a technology I'd like to add to the mix at some point. Basically, it takes all of the assets in a site (JS, CSS, Images) and smooshes them into one file for each type, nicely minified and stuff. Removing Bootstrap was a good start, loading the post index now requires 11 requests and 81 KB, where it used to take 16 requests and 184 KB. Webpack and gzip can likely  shrink that way further.</p>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>I've mentioned this before, but I'd really like to add comments to the site and allow for some discussion. I have a working integration with <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, but I'm considering rolling my own solution, for maximum flexibility and minimal external dependencies.</p>
<h3>RSS/SEO Improvements</h3>
<p>While the RSS feed works, it's not as fully-featured as it could be, particularly around things like images. Similarly, there are some &lt;meta&gt; tags I could add to posts to make it clearer for search engines and screen readers what's going on in a given page.</p>
<h3>Build Your Own Savings Clock</h3>
<p>When one savings clock dies, another is born. I've been working on a new page for the site that allows people to track progress on something they care about, whether it's dollars saved, calories burned, tacos eaten, you name it. It's not quite ready for prime time yet, but I'll definitely post when it is.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Brief aside:</strong> Like all projects I work on in my spare time, I expect there to be a few hiccups and bumps with the updated site. As always, send me an email or a question to let me know about any problems with the site.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><span style="font-size:2.5em; color:#444;">Once</span> upon a time there was an ugly truck.</p>
<p>He was a lonely soul, a poor mess of rust and twisted metal, left to idle all alone. While certainly a sad state of affairs, it hadn't always been this way for him. In his youth as a rental truck, he'd helped families move every which way. Later, he became a work truck, the lifeblood of an independent carpenter. As fulfilling as his past had been, it had also left its fair share of chips and dents and scrapes and scratches, which he wore like badges of honor.</p>
<p>In his present life (though one could hardly call it "living"*), home was a used-car dealership along the side of a small expressway in Fremont, California. With his mangled bumpers, duct-taped roof, graffiti'd paneling, and rusted roll-up doors, he was hidden far away at the back, but not far enough to mute the mocking jeers of the newer trucks at the front. With their lower mileage, more recent model years, gleaming, uncracked paint jobs, and complete lack of leaks, they were much more appealing and were quickly swept off to their new exciting lives. After a while, the ugly truck had lost all hope that he would ever have a purpose in life again, and he resigned himself to decay in silence.</p>
<p>Then one day, a boy appeared at the dealership, nervous and apprehensive. He looked lost and out of place as he ambled around the parking lot, passing diffident, fleeting glances at each of the trucks. Eventually his ambling brought him to the back of the lot, where the ugly truck had been half-halfheartedly watching, not wanting to get raise his dejected spirits for nothing. But it wasn't for nothing! The boy looked hopefully at the ugly truck, his eyes full of future plans. As they drove around the dealership for the first time, the ugly truck knew that things were going to be alright.</p>
<p class="text-center">[The End]</p>
<p class="text-center"><sup><sup>[...or the beginning, depending on how you want to look at it]</sup></sup></p>
<hr>
<p>Poorly shoehorned children's stories aside, the truck has been an important part of my life ever since that fateful day, nearly two years ago. Neither of us has metamorphosed into a beautiful swan by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd like to think that we're both improving as time goes on, with each passing project. Not that improving was particularly hard, I mean, look how low the bar was set:</p>
<div class="inline-image">

<p>Our sorry protagonist, the ugly truckling.</p>
</div>
<p>I only dredge up the truck's roots to highlight how far it's come. I'd previously <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/rain-rain-go-away/5760820306771968">alluded to</a> some of the work I wanted to have done, and I'm happy to report I just got it back from the shop, shiny and freshly improved.</p>
<h2>Truck 2.0</h2>
<p>When I first talked to the body shop, I asked them for quotes on a whole gamut of repairs and improvements, ranging from replacing and resealing the entire floor to swapping out the roll-up backdoor for some swing doors. Independently, I researched how much these repairs should cost, and kept a spreadsheet of the maximum price I was willing to pay for each individual unit of truck work. The quote I got back was more than twice the cost of the entire truck, and then some ($21,600!). While the raw magnitude of the price tag was initially shocking to me, it actually wasn't outrageous given the laundry list of improvements I had asked for. I simply said no to each thing that was out of my budget and quickly crossed them off my wishlist. For the remaining, in-budget items, I gave them the proverbial green light. In the end, I ended up having the top radius and corner caps replaced, getting a new driver's side fender, and getting an inner door installed.</p>
<h3>No More Leaks</h3>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uYXSpt-UMzgyyk0PTN-z5S2npSpPAm6UfRFoOKbMImeilFjrOBKd9UUxziQE_AUj_OCrQOFSiD0wEKBSjrJ8u0elpcDbsZAunq8=s375"/>

<p>Shiny new top radius and smooth, uninterrupted fiberglass.</p>
</div>
<p>By far the biggest problem I had with the truck was <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/rain-rain-go-away/5760820306771968">the leaks</a>. Not "leaks" in the White House sense of the word, I don't think I have any truck secrets to hide. Rather, "leaks" as in, if I did nothing about it, I would wake up in a dank truck swamp after a rainy night. The increasingly obnoxious and unsightly hacks I had put in place to mitigate the issue weren't going to work forever, it was just a plain ole fact that I needed something more permanent. So I had the cracked, scratched, and dented fixings around the perimeter of the truck-top replaced, figuring that the damage there was causing the leaks. I also had all-new clearance lights installed in the front and back, for good measure.</p>
<p>The good news is that the truck-top was indeed the problem. The bad news is that there is still the <em>slightest</em> of leaks. Like, a multi-hour downpour last week only resulted in a few drops. I'm still on the fence as to whether or not I want to bring it back in and have it looked at, or if I should just throw marine sealant at it until it gives up.</p>
<h3>Shiny New Headlight</h3>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S81aNxEUbfxln7J2mcVJcAOYc0qCIvDCjl9sP-AQIDtK0SktZE4xVLM4eX3_F3_dbJujK2AqdPRR4A5GLWuMp4KnI90dUiUMsBQn=s450"/>
<p>Driver's side headlight, good as new.</p>
</div>
<p>I swear, that is an actual, real-life picture of my truck, though I hardly recognize it myself. The fender is all new, as is the headlight and the header panel assembly that everything slots into. You may (or may not) remember that it was <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tragedy-strikes/5747976207073280">damaged</a> early on by some unexplained phenomenon.</p>
<p>Something I realized way after the fact: the headlight <em>may</em> have actually been dislodged earlier than I noticed, maybe even before I bought the truck. My tentative hypothesis is that it just got worse and more noticeable over time, the more I drove it. This is pretty believable because I'm extremely unobservant. And looking at some of my old, grainy, potato-quality photos I could find of the truck, it looks like the headlight may have already been knocked out of its mount. In any case, it's a 1,000% improvement: shiny, new, correctly attached, and forbidden from coming into contact with anything ever again.</p>
<h3>Super Stealth Mode</h3>
<div class="inline-image">

<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wporSH1zvz0cZvIhiTnzSSSCCgsiC-cJCj88147g6zMjEH5cBHy9QfpHH9kjJCrVkz37WDb-n0AFeacYHh5kDAfXWlVi-5dkA4V=s375"/>
<p>My new gateway to and from Narnia.</p>
</div>
<p>This was probably the least practical piece of work I had done, but also my favorite. Ever since I first got the truck, I've always had to think very carefully about where I park it. I only had one entrance/exit, and it was a giant, gaping square void at the back of the truck. If I parked facing a busy area, it meant my comings and goings were laid bare for all to see, which is awkward when I need to grab something from The Box&#8482; in the middle of the day when I'm out and/or about.</p>
<p>But "awkwardness" and "social stigma" aren't things I've historically been concerned about. Arguably more importantly, my singular door meant that I couldn't lock the back gate while I was in the truck, so anyone could come in&#8230;while I was sleeping (and at my most vulnerable). This was never actually an issue, except for one time, when my friends "broke in" at midnight on my birthday with beer and cheesecake. And if being force-fed Smirnoff in a hazy half-slumber is the worst thing to come out of my willy-nilly approach to security, I think I'm doing alright.</p>
<p>Cheesecake and beer aside, I eventually wised up and implemented a simple, somewhat secure solution, suggested to me by a few readers. The solution was this: Once the door is in a mostly-down position, clamp vice grips over each of the roll-up door tracks. This way, the rollers will get caught on the vice grips if someone attempted to open it. With enough force, someone could probably still open the door, but they'd make a real racket in the process. It might not be a coincidence that I started doing this right after some <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/strange-times-in-truck-town/5756035713204224">strange happenings</a> in my neck of the <del>woods</del> asphalt.</p>
<p>But vice grips and surprise cheesecake are both things of the past, because one of the new truck improvements was an interior door leading from the driver's compartment into my pleasantly prismic pigsty. When I told the body shop I wanted an interior door installed, I was expecting a simple sliding door or something on a hinge. What I got was way more interesting, and hilariously over-engineered. As I understand it, they had this really nice roll-up door sitting around not doing anything, and they were like, "Yeah sure, that'll do". So they measured and cut and welded and eventually this functional Franken-door came into being. They didn't charge me for the door (which they said was worth $2,000+), so I certainly wasn't complaining.</p>
<p>I've been using the door for a few weeks now, and I have to say that I'm thoroughly enjoying it. It's taken some getting used to though; it must weigh nearly 50 pounds and doesn't have a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Doors-Windows-Residential-Garage-Doors-Openers-Accessories-Garage-Door-Springs/Torsion-Spring/N-5yc1vZbnqtZ1z0ksc2">conventional garage door torsion spring</a>, so it's kind of unwieldy to work with.  I've figured out an awkward little dance to close the door behind me when I get out in the morning, but there's still definitely room for improvement. The big benefits are that I can keep the back gate locked shut all the time, park in whatever orientation I damn well want, and come and go whenever I damn well please. Very liberating indeed.</p>
<h2>What's the Damage?</h2>
<p>Moving on, it's clear I had a good chunk of work done. And as it turns out, people and labor and truck parts and stuff don't come cheap. In total, the repairs cost me a healthy ~$3,800.</p>
<p><em>Brandon, that's an obscene amount of money! And in my humble opinion,
 you're an idiot.</em></p>
<p>It's definitely not a small sum of money, but hear me out: I know that I plan on selling the truck eventually, even if <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-question-of-time/5746311907246080">I don't know when</a>. Since it's already fairly old (2006) and I don't drive it a lot, it's not going to depreciate much further, as long as I keep it in decent shape. Letting the wood rot from the leaks, or the headlight fall out completely wouldn't exactly be "keeping it in decent shape". Plus, since I plan on selling it as a super-secret-stealth-hardcore-camper-truck-type-thing, improvements like the interior door make a lot of sense. So the benefit is two-fold: I get to take advantage of all the improvements now, and they make the truck more valuable in the long run. But even if the repairs and improvements didn't add any value to the truck whatsoever, $3,800 isn't that expensive when you phrase it as "<em>two months rent</em>".</p>
<p><em>And another question, where did you stay when the repairs were being done? Did you just roam the streets?</em></p>
<p>First question: Alaska!</p>
<p>Second question: No.</p>

<p>Both images were carefully selected to highlight how philosophical and mysterious I am.</p>
</div>
<p>In total, the truck spent like a week and a half in the body shop. Luckily, this happened to somewhat coincide with a trip my friends and I were taking to Alaska. So I drove the truck to the body shop, caught a ride 10 minutes to the airport, and off I went. When I got back from Alaska, I spent a few days at my non-truck-homed girlfriend's place.</p>
<h2>Why the Ugly Truck?</h2>
<p>Reading over the allegory of the Ugly Truckling, there's a question that naturally leaps to mind: why didn't I pick a more reasonable vehicle, like an RV, or even just one of the newer, nicer trucks?</p>
<p>I've touched on some of this in the past, but I didn't want an RV because I was worried that would be too comfortable and I would forget why I was even doing this in the first place: because the world outside my four walls is infinitely more interesting, and that's where I want to spend my time. I didn't pick a newer, shinier truck because I liked (and still like) the idea of a fixer-upper. I wanted to be able to rip apart the interior without worrying I was doing damage, and attempt little repairs on my own. Thus far, I think it's been a pretty solid learning opportunity.</p>
<p>I certainly had a few ulterior motives too. Older trucks are naturally cheaper, and like I mentioned above, they also leave less room to depreciate. Less logically, a silly anecdote from my childhood might explain why I gravitated to the Ugly Truckling:</p>
<p>When I was little, I spent a lot of time at my grandmother's house. She had this set of ceramic-handled silverware, and from looking at them, you could tell they'd been around since The War. Which war it was, nobody knew for sure. But anyway, a bunch of the spoons had chips in their ceramic handles, and I was always careful to avoid those ones. One day, my grandmother caught me carefully picking my spoon and asked me what I was doing. When I explained that some of the spoons were broken, this is what she said to me:</p>
<br/>
<p class="text-center">"Broken spoons need love too."</p>
<br/>
<p>And it's stuck with me ever since.</p>
<br/>
<p>*<em class="small">Partly because it was a sad excuse for an existence, and partly because trucks are inanimate objects and don't "live" in the way that humans and other animate organisms do.</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I'd <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-land-of-fire-and-ice/5666313846390784">previously mentioned</a> that I had an upcoming work trip to Z&#252;rich, and in keeping with my usual blogging tardiness, that trip was two months ago. Actually, I (perhaps ironically) got back from India a few weeks ago, so expect that post <del>soon</del> in a few millennia. But anyway, let's talk about Switzerland: a country of cheese, chocolates, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_neutrality">armed neutrality</a>*.</p>
<br/>

<p>Waiting to leave SFO on a gloomy evening.</p>
</div>
<h1>Leaving <sup>on <sup>a <sup>jet <sup>plane </sup></sup></sup></sup></h1>
<p>As it turns out, Z&#252;rich is kinda far away. Like, 5,889.11 miles, give or take a few. Luckily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers">the Wright Brothers</a> solved this problem a while ago, so off I went on a fancy, new-fangled flying machine in relative luxury. I've been consistently impressed with the quality of economy class on international flights (first Lufthansa, and now Swiss), they really put our domestic carriers to shame. Between the hot meals, warm cloths so you aren't bathing in your own face-grease the whole flight, and honest-to-God leg room, my mind is legitimately blown every time. Fun fact that I didn't know until recently: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2014/01/05/elliott-let-foreign-airlines-fly-domestic-routes/4329825/">foreign airlines can't operate point-to-point routes within the US</a>. Given that, it makes sense that domestic airlines aren't really trying that hard, they only have to compete with like two other equally awful carriers on most routes.</p>
<p>Moving on from my tangent: though the plane was a slightly more tubular metal container than I'm used to sleeping in, I slept soundly, in spite of the shape. A short 11 hours after takeoff,** I found myself in Z&#252;rich.</p>
<h2>Taking the Train</h2>
<p>Being able to navigate in a foreign country is a useful skill, not only for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Race_(U.S._TV_series)">Amazing Race</a> contestants. Unfortunately, navigating public transit is also a skill I sorely lack, which is ironic because I used to drive public buses. But anyway, the trains (and the rest of public transportation in Switzerland) are really, really good. So good in fact, it can be a bit overwhelming for someone used to the US's decidedly mediocre public offerings. After a bit of jet-lagged, blank-eyed staring at a departure board for longer than I'd like to admit, I hopped on a train heading in the general direction I was going: Z&#252;rich HB, the main Z&#252;rich train station.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BVKpKAhdlEBanbEZHxORV9GjOG5oMHCQf2CUUbQsmXoazm9zfLxeyculUA6p2TwU6Zz2qfOiIpHpWZzIr9RLxsTLLm-vnZ3XjZ9g=s400"/>
<p>A rough depiction of what I found myself up against, from <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2010/12/day-of-chocolate-in-zurich.html">DC Rainmaker</a></p>
</div>
<p>The trains in Z&#252;rich are <em>buttery</em> smooth, like riding on velvety Swiss clouds. I never noticed how rocky train rides here are, but comparatively, it feels more like I'm riding a jackhammer when I Caltrain up to San Francisco. I'm being dramatic, but the trains in Switzerland are indeed modern marvels of engineering. As a testament to their coolness, a Z&#252;rich-based co-worker told me that if the trains are more than a few minutes late, people start Snapchat-ing and Tweet-ing pics of the late train, because they're usually so punctual. Not only are they timely, but they also go <em>everywhere</em>, <strong>including up mountains</strong>. We were able to get to the top of Mount Rigi with a few trains and five minutes of walking. Take notes, America.</p>
<h2>Doing Some Exploring</h2>
<p>Regrettably, I didn't have a lot of time to explore. I was, after all, on a work trip. Had that not been the case, I'd likely have started each morning at the main train station and picked a random train to dictate the plans for the day. I did at least <em>attempt</em> to do some exploring though. But words are boring, so instead of making you read about it, here are some pictures.</p>
<h3>Lucerne</h3>
<div class="inline-image">

<p>Lucerne (or Luzern, depending on who you're talking to) has a rich history that stretches back to the 8th century, and you can see a lot of that history in a lot of the architecture, which has been preserved or restored. It's also just a beautiful area.</p>

<p>I have an infinitely-exploitable*** soft spot for cute animals. I found this majestic and sagacious creature at the top of Mount Rigi and had to stop for a pic (and some petting).</p>
</div>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>I was surprised to find that one of my favorite things about Switzerland was the weather. Silicon Valley has a watered-down version of seasons, and Z&#252;rich in the winter reminded me a lot of Boston. It was part nostalgia, part missing the sensation of crisp winter air, but in any case it was immensely enjoyable. I frequently found myself stepping outside, solely to take some slow, deep, refreshing breaths.</p>
<h3>Language and Economics</h3>
<p>It probably shouldn't surprise me at this point, but everyone in Switzerland speaks some combination of German, French, Italian, and English, and usually at least three of those. It's at least in part because the EU is a giant cultural melting pot, but I was impressed no less. Interestingly enough, the Swiss dialect of German is incomprehensible to German speakers from Germany, though the written language is mostly the same. At least that's my understanding. In a vaguely-related train of thought, everyone being so multi-lingual and high-skilled means that even jobs that would usually be considered "entry-level" in the US pay really well. In fact, <a href="https://www.myscience.ch/living/salary/salary_in_switzerland">only 10% of jobs pay less than ~$50,000/year</a>. As a result, service industry staples like restaurants are comparatively really expensive, because <em>people</em> are expensive.</p>
<h3>Driving</h3>
<p>While I (thankfully) didn't do any driving in Switzerland, I did spend quite a bit of time watching other people do it. To my untrained eyes, it looked pretty complicated. There were tons of signs and lanes, and the trains would lackadaisically wander back and forth between dedicated lanes and mixing in with the general population. Switzerland also seems to take joy in sprinkling random intersections with roundabouts. They still drive on the right side of the road though, so no added confusion there.</p>
<h3>Sledding</h3>
<p>I forgot how much fun sledding is. I hadn't been since I was a wee lad, and even then I wasn't sledding down <em>full-blown mountains</em>. Rekindling the flames of my childhood, I raced down several sled trails at borderline reckless speeds, laughing hysterically throughout the entire chaotic decent. I definitely destroyed the tread on my boots in the process; stomping your feet is the only way to turn or slow down (unless you're willing to stop with your face). But I'd trade in the tread in an instant to do it again.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I had the good fortune to sample at least two of those things during my short trip.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small"><a href="https://www.swiss.com">Swiss</a> conveniently flies direct from SFO -&gt; ZRH.</em></p>

<em>Source: <span>Trying out a new (slightly less anatomically accurate) truck graphic this time, from <a href="http://tumundografico.com/clipart/truck-clipart.html">Tumundografico</a></span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Each <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Money">financial post</a> I do brings at least a few questions about my plan or different investment strategies. Before we get to it, I'll start with my usual disclaimer that I have no background in finance or financial planning, and taking financial advice exclusively from the guy living in a box truck probably isn't a sound strategy. With that out of the way, let's get to the questions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you invest in bitcoins?</strong></em></p>
<p>Nope. Aside from reading <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">the white paper</a> on Bitcoin, I'm not all that knowledgeable about it, and my current allotment of funds is about the right level of risk for me (&gt;90% stocks, all broad index funds). Plus, I think unless you <em>really</em> know what you're doing, it's dangerous to treat a currency like a commodity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why race to pay off a loan with 3.4% interest? That's equivalent to investing at a 3.4% annual return, which is not a great return rate.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is referring to my now non-existent <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/indebted/5690820929781760">student loans</a>. I don't have a great answer for this one, except that I did delay paying the loans off for about six months, for exactly the reason given in the question. However, I do think there's something to be said about the psychological comfort of not having any debt looming ominously overhead. In my opinion, that was worth the decreased rate of return on my investment. In any case, I'm clearly not rushing to get a mortgage any time soon.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it is that paying off my loans was a way of de-risking my portfolio a bit. The overwhelming majority of my portfolio is stocks, so "investing" $20,000 at 3.4% is like a really well-performing bond. It's a bit of a stretch, but the math works out.</p>
<p><em><strong>Seems like you're putting a lot of money into accounts you won't be able to access until you're around 60 years old. Wondering if you're planning to save enough in cash or non-IRAs to live on from when you're in your 30s until you are able to withdraw from the tax-advantaged accounts. Have you done the math on how much you'll need during that time?</strong></em></p>
<p>Nope, haven't done much of the math around this, but we can dabble in it now. I've been known to throw around phrases like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study">"Trinity Study"</a> and <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Safe_withdrawal_rates">"Safe Withdrawal Rate"</a>, which is to say once I have a nest egg equal to 25x my yearly spending, I can (in theory) be financially-independent indefinitely. And while that's a good high-level description, it glosses over some of the details mentioned in the question here, mainly that my "nest egg" isn't a single account, it's spread over a bunch of different types of accounts, some of which have disparate and intentionally complicated rules.</p>
<p>My plans are nicely summed up by a Vanguard article I came across recently, titled <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/youssef-portfolio-tax-efficient-092016?cmpgn=EXT:DP:RIG:TaxTime:0113:RIG:TaxTime:TaxEff:SO:XX"><strong>5 ways to make your portfolio more tax-efficient</strong></a>. The first item on their list is "Save as much as you can in tax-advantaged accounts", which I definitely do. I max out every possible tax-advantaged account I can get my hands on. The thinking is that the less money I subject to taxes (either now or later), the more money is available to grow and compound.</p>
<p>Skipping item two (and four and five), the third item from the Vanguard article is "Tap into your accounts in the right order", and this is where the math and planning come into play. For the sake of argument, let's say that I do this for 9 years. The first account to draw from is my non-tax-advantaged, normal brokerage account. About a year and a half into my adventure, this account has collected about $55,000 dollars. Doing some extremely conservative calculations (5% growth, yearly compounding, +$33,000/year), I'll have about $450,000 at the end of that 9 year period.</p>
<p>Once I've sucked all of the money out of my brokerage account, the next fund I would dip into is my Roth IRA. The big trick here is that I can withdraw <strong>the principal</strong> without paying any tax or penalty. Since I'm contributing the max $27,000/year to that, that's an additional $243,000 (remember, just the principal, no gains) I can take out whenever I need. After that's been exhausted, I can take out some tax-free HSA money offset with medical expenses paid out of pocket over the next nine years, and there are a few other rules and exceptions I can use to squeeze out a few more penalty-free dollars (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantially_equal_periodic_payments">SEPPs</a>, <a href="http://rootofgood.com/roth-ira-conversion-ladder-early-retirement/">Roth Conversion Ladders</a>, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-tax-on-early-distributions">Other Exceptions</a>, oh my!).</p>
<p>Conservatively, that means I'll have $450,000 + $243,000 + HSA and other stuff = ~$700,000. Since 9 years have passed in this hypothetical example, I'd be around 33 years old. Do I think I could make $700,000 last for the 27-32 years until I can start taking penalty-free 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA distributions? Using the rule-of-thumb Safe Withdrawal Rate, this means I'd be living on ~$28,000 a year. While not impossible, it'd be a little tighter than I'd like it to be. I have a few options here for augmenting that income: 1) mess around with SEPPs and conversion ladders, 2) take the penalty, <a href="http://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/">which isn't totally unreasonable</a>, or 3) don't retire in 9 years.</p>
<p>It's very likely that the actual solution here is: 4) all the above. If my goals are in the same place in five years or so, I'll probably quit working in the traditional sense, and pick up one-off contract jobs like I used to do in college. I could also work remotely/part-time. The supplemental income from the part-time work would hopefully be enough to live minimally, but comfortably.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there a fee for each time you do the rollover? If so, have you done the analysis to see how long you should wait to do the rollover to the Roth?</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/rollovers-of-after-tax-contributions-in-retirement-plans">Nope!</a> No fees, but I do have to remember to do it every paycheck, because you do have to pay taxes on the gains when you do the rollover. So if I do it immediately, there's usually either $0.00 or $0.01 of tax to pay. But because I'm extremely easily distracted, sometimes I'll forget about it for a week or so, and then I end up having to pay like a whole dollar or two of tax. Not a big deal, but it's something I'll likely have to think about when doing my taxes this month.</p>
<p><em><strong>I thought if you maxed out your normal 401k (the pre-tax one) you could not contribute more funds to the after-tax 401k in the same calendar year. Am I mistaken about that?</strong></em></p>
<p>In short: yes, you are indeed mistaken.</p>
<p>In slightly less short: the IRS has <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-announces-2017-pension-plan-limitations-401k-contribution-limit-remains-unchanged-at-18000-for-2017">two separate limits</a> that are relevant here. The first is the pre-tax employee 401k contribution limit, which is $18,000 for 2017, and only includes your own personal contributions. The second limit is the <strong>overall</strong> 401k contribution limit, which is $54,000 for 2017 and includes your personal contributions, employer contributions, and after-tax contributions. I contribute $18,000 to pre-tax, and my employer matches $9,000, which leaves me $54,000 - ($18,000 + $9,000) = $27,000 to contribute to my after-tax 401k in 2017.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I don't think it rained once when I interned in the Bay in 2014. The <strong>summer</strong> of 2014, to be specific. Doing a bit of overzealous extrapolation, I came to the <sup>incorrect</sup> conclusion that it never rains in the Bay, which sounded just splendid to me. Before I moved out here to start a full-time job in 2015, I donated my boots, raincoat, and any umbrellas I had. When I actually got here and bought the truck, I didn't even bother checking for leaks. You can tell where this is going, and anyone from the area knows that I made a grave miscalculation. I found this out the hard way during my first winter here. </p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_Valley#Climate">climate data for the area</a> (which I clearly hadn't), it averages a meager ~0.75 inches of rain over the entirety of May, June, July, August, <strong>and</strong> September, as my 2014 observations suggested. Much to my chagrin, the weather swiftly turns from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde around October, dropping more rain than the preceding five months (0.85 inches) <strong>combined</strong>. It doubles down in November and drops twice as much (1.83 inches). It drops that, plus another half inch in December (2.3 inches), and ups the ante another inch for January and February (3.2 inches each). Which leads me to my inspiration for this post: just prior to writing this, it rained for nearly two straight weeks.</p>
<h2>Dealing with Mrs. Nature</h2>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship with rain. On one hand, it's great not living in an arid wasteland, and <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Drought-Over-For-More-Than-40-Percent-of-California-410581785.html">the Bay needs all the water it can get</a>. On the other hand, the rain definitely makes my life more challenging. Not only does a gentle drizzle on the box truck roof sound like a safe full of silverware tumbling down an infinite escalator, but my truck isn't exactly waterproof either. Basically, the rain and I are in a nuclear arms race, and I'm definitely losing.</p>
<h3>A History of Failed Solutions</h3>
<p>When I encountered my first real leak, jury-rigging <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/keeping-dry/5678807906254848">a pipe and a bucket</a> to divert the water was sufficient. But like a sinking ship in an old cartoon, more leaks quickly sprung up, and I needed to be more proactive in my game of fluid fisticuffs. So I <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-project-6-fixing-the-hole/5740423507083264">fixed <em>part</em> of the problem</a>, and the leaks lessened. But my Band-Aids were no match for a through-and-through downpour, forcing me to resort to strategically-placed <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-for-the-holidays/5758531089203200">trash bags</a> to contain the current. After attempting to track down the leaks, I went back on the offensive and slathered some marine sealant around what I thought were the problem areas. And up to a certain amount of rain, trash bags and a bit of active leak mitigation actually isn't that bad of a solution. But when it rains for two weeks straight, a few problems start to creep up:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The garbage bags start to accumulate a lot of water.</li>
<li>That aforementioned water evaporates during the day and the truck turns into a weird, damp, Humid Truck Swamp&#8482;.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>An Inflection Point</h3>
<p>The Humid Truck Swamp is more of a nuisance than a real issue, but the whole premise of living in a truck was that I thought I could do it without sacrificing any of my happiness. And there was no sense in trying to spin it, I found this unpleasant.</p>
<p>I've talked about when would be a good time to <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-question-of-time/5746311907246080">call it quits</a>, and if I were a slightly more reasonable person, I very well may have decided that this was that time. Maybe the truck isn't actually worth all of this effort. But my skull is a bit thicker than average and deep down, I <em>do</em> legitimately enjoy trying to tackle these kinds of problems. So instead of selling the truck and being normal for a change, I did what any serial sadist would do, and just moved to a more elaborate crutch, pictured here:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g6f7EunQvWTfYhxOLGai2zMlKUy5IrUczd7S9WwidtHq4vau7lt7yvDKEDt_Ta99NYKum5_FZRp40H3WWo4cVPLtO-qqzzzu5-Ai=s500"/>
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IsY_gFB1azRefV0uEK8mBphyW9u0ogY5eQCi_qU5icwViUOsHjlZVbjOOS7irXaR5bI2fEiRGaHA4BTyoUEh6zD75K6vE6SCTstb=s500"/>
<p>Opposing top front corners of the box, looking like a scene from a <em>Breaking Bad</em> knockoff. The Shrek-snot insulation also makes a cameo.</p>
</div>
<p>I know, it's looking <em>pretty</em> grim in there. Like, next-level truck dungeon grim. In case it's not obvious what's going on: instead of letting the leaks drip directly into a trash bag, now they drip into an extremely jankily-placed funnel, secured by several feet of extra strong duct tape. The funnel is inserted into a few feet of plastic hosing, which, in turn, is fastened to trash bags of varying sizes by an ever-increasing amount of duct tape. This solves the humidity problem because the surface area for the water to evaporate from is now far, far smaller. I set this up a few weeks ago, and it's actually worked surprisingly well.</p>
<h2>Ending the Arms Race</h2>
<p>It's painfully obvious at this point that I'm reaching the limits of my mechanical capabilities in this fight. I can't keep relying on ever-more complicated crutches. Further, I have to be careful to not let myself normalize these terrible hacks, lest I end up with an unacceptably low or even hazardous standard of living. This was my line in the sand: It was time to actually fix the underlying problem. Accordingly, I brought the truck into a body shop to get a quote, and I'm hoping to have the box repaired in the next week or so, ending the arms race and allowing me to focus on actual truck improvements.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if there are any good lessons to be learned here. Seven months out of the year, this isn't even a problem, and I'm rapidly on the way to rectifying those other five months. Looking back on it all, I'm actually glad it rains here sometimes. Aside from the obvious environmental problems of not having any rain, it forced me to think outside the box, hone my duct tape-fu, and in the end, make some real, permanent improvements to my home. Plus, how could I appreciate the sunshine without a bit of rain?</p>

<p class="text-center">New Year, <del>New Me</del> Same Truck-Dwelling Degenerate</p>
<p>Excuse the contrarianism for a second here, but I'm not a fan of New Year's Resolutions. Don't get me wrong, I love seeing people take the initiative, work hard, and reach their goals. My qualm is that, if you want to change something about your life, <strong>just do it</strong>. Don't wait until we reach an arbitrary point in our orbit around the Sun to better yourself. After all, January 1<sup>st</sup> is a day just like any other, nothing makes it any more conducive to success.</p>
<p>Complaining aside, that's not to say I don't have plans for myself in the New Year, I definitely do. They're just the same plans I've been working with and tweaking for the past year and a half. If someone in a hypothetical and unnecessarily violent world put a gun to my head and asked me to sum up, in a single word, what my plans are, I'd probably say: "<em>Investing</em>".</p>
<h2>Investing</h2>
<p>"<em>Investing in what?</em>" you may ask. I've already <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/of-trucks-and-tax-advantaged-accounts/5671321778257920">talked about</a> how I've been investing in index funds like <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0970">VTI</a> and <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=3369&amp;FundIntExt=INT">VXUS</a> through my 401k, Roth IRA, HSA, and brokerage accounts, and nothing has changed there. That's all still on auto-pilot, silently siphoned out of my paycheck and quietly compounding interest. And it's still working really well for me, and has already netted me &gt;$10,000 in dividends and appreciation.*</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wqWSiKgAJV4LzclDN4d7mwOdMphg1MkE1c7wSwivBa9pSdOWixzGqZxawu38KwmQUir1kvjFmwbHaN0K_835MifgRgbK5s9RNvCI=s500"/>
<p>My investments through Vanguard, a year and a half in.</p>
</div>
<p>But with <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/indebted/5690820929781760">my student loans paid off</a> and a freshly-minted promotion, I should start looking to diversify my assets outside of stocks, especially as I start to build up a more sizable <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nestegg.asp">nest egg</a> . So we'll start with some more of the <em>financial</em> investing I'm considering, but that's far from the only way one can invest.</p>
<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>Okay, so the stock situation is solid and doesn't need any intervention, at least until I near retirement and start investing more heavily in bonds, per <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/of-trucks-and-tax-advantaged-accounts/5671321778257920">Bob's advice</a>. But still, it wouldn't be particularly savvy to keep &gt;95% of my wealth tied to the performance of two funds, regardless of how diversified each may be. So, I've been looking at my options, and there are a few promising avenues. for consideration</p>
<h4>Real Estate</h4>
<p><em>Brandon, how the hell are you going to invest in real estate when you live in a truck?</em></p>
<p>It's true, one of the reasons I live in a truck is because housing is ridiculously expensive out here, and buying a home (or rental property) would require me making deals with some unsavory, otherworldly creatures. That said, I <em>can</em> invest in <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp">REITs</a>. REITs, or <strong>R</strong>eal <strong>E</strong>state <strong>I</strong>nvestment <strong>T</strong>rusts, are traded like stocks, but are primarily invested in real estate and mortgages and other things that track the value of the real estate market. So I might not being able to buy a home, but REITs are a less messy way for a beginner to get into the real estate market. At the very least, I need to do more research on their risks, returns, and tax properties before I actually put my money where <del>my mouth</del> a house is.</p>
<h4>Peer-to-Peer Lending</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_lending">Peer-to-Peer Lending</a> is another type of investing where, you guessed it, money is lent between peers. Sites like <a href="https://www.peerstreet.com">PeerStreet</a> and <a href="https://patchofland.com/">Patch of Land</a> allow you to choose from a catalog of (usually real estate-related) loans to invest in, and as the loan gets paid off, you get a proportional chunk of the interest. You can vary the "quality" (read: riskiness) of the loans you're willing to fund in exchange for potentially higher returns and correspondingly higher default rates. These sites quote yearly returns of  6-12% on your investment, which is definitely enough to warrant a more thorough look.</p>
<p>It sounds good for sure, but there are naturally a few things worth considering. For one, loans are far less liquid than stocks are, it's not as easy to sell your stake in a loan. You <em>can</em> sell your share on a secondary loan market, but that's not nearly as simple as selling a stock. The other wrench in the mix: depending on the peer-to-peer site, most loans are only available to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor">accredited investors</a>, which requires (among other things) having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor#United_States">a net worth of <strong>one million dollars</strong></a>. As nice as that would be, I'm clearly not there yet. As with REITs above, I need to do more research to determine the viability of investing with these sites. </p>
<h3>The Truck</h3>
<p>It's <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-question-of-time/5746311907246080">no secret</a> that I plan on dumping the truck at some point.  Hopefully not anytime soon though; it's not particularly well-suited for being sold in it's current state. If you think about it, there're two groups of people that'd be interested in it: people who need moving trucks, and people who want to live in vans. The problem is that it'd be weird to use as a moving truck, because it has weird amenities, like a coat rack, insulation, a bike rack, and a sky light.  And unless you have a <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-day-in-the-life-weekday-edition/5645478960037888">routine</a> very similar to mine, the truck doesn't really provide enough utility to make it a full-time residence. So the market for people who would buy my truck as is&#8230;well, it's likely just me. And I think it goes without saying I'm not in the market at the moment. I'll save the details for their own post, but I have a bunch of plans for making the truck more palatable for all of those lurking potential stealth campers out there.</p>
<h3>Myself</h3>
<p>Investing in yourself is arguably the most important investment you can make. After all, you only have one fleshy meat body and sponge brain to pilot around your consciousness. We're all pretty much stuck with the results of whatever investments we make in ourselves.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I'd like to read a bunch of books that I've started but have yet to finish, mainly because I have the attention span of a guppy.** I'd also like to finish a bunch of half-written blog posts that have been collecting virtual dust on my server, along with a fancy-shmancy unfinished site-redesign.</p>
<p>On the fleshy-meat-side-of-things, I've been tweaking <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/picking-things-up-and-putting-them-down/5651874166341632">my workout routine</a>, and I'd really like to break 1,000 combined pounds on my bench, squat, and deadlift, ideally without becoming potato-shaped. On the cardiovascular-side of things, a friend of mine recently mentioned doing the <a href="http://www.aidslifecycle.org/">AIDS/LifeCycle</a> 7-day bike ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles, which sounds like great motivation for whipping my cardio into shape.</p>
<h3>Why Investing is the Cat's Pajamas</h3>
<p>The nice thing about investing is that the results generally compound on themselves. It's pretty easy to see this with monetary investments, where compound interest and re-invested dividends are real, tangible values. But it rings just as true with investments in yourself as well, just in less-visible ways. For example, regular exercise keeps your <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4771152/">resting heart rate low</a>, which means your heart doesn't have to work nearly as hard for <strong>the rest of your life</strong>. This has great perks, like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473759">decreased risk for cardiovascular disease</a>. And if Not Dying&#8482; isn't a good enough reason to invest in something, I don't know what is.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">Naturally, the gains and losses are wholly irrelevant until I start taking distributions and realizing it as income, which likely won't happen for another ten years. Still, it's fun to look at it every so often, even with no intention of doing anything with it.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">For the curious, the books are: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Martian-Andy-Weir/dp/0553418025">The Martian</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy/dp/0345453743">The Hitchhiker's Guide series</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Walden-Henry-David-Thoreau/dp/1619493918">Walden</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Achievement-Factory-Fulfill-Dreams-Adventure/dp/1499551193">The Achievement Factory</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474">The Millionaire Next Door</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116932">Search Inside Yourself</a>.</em></p>

<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
<p>I'm going to need a minute to blow the dust off my keyboard here, I haven't posted in an <em>inexcusably</em> long time. Accordingly, I won't bother with excuses, I'll just get along with the post. To start, a relevant question I received:</p>
<p><strong><em>Hi Brandon, just wondering if you'll convert your blog into a travel blog if and when you give up the truck to travel?</em></strong></p>
<p>This is probably in reference to the time I was <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-question-of-time/5746311907246080">figuring out when I'm going to sell the truck</a>. Short answer: yes. Slightly longer (and also rhetorical) answer: why wait until I give up the truck to start talking about travel?</p>
<p>For anyone keeping track, my list of travels is woefully short. At the beginning of the year it would have just been <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Murika&amp;defid=6832625">'murika</a>, as in <em>I had literally never been outside the country in my 23 years on this planet</em>, which was deeply troubling to me. Not even Canada. Not even Mexico. Hell, I didn't even have a passport. If not for a chance <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-taste-of-tomorrow/5734977488551936">business trip</a> to Canada and (randomly enough) Bulgaria, my entire list of visited countries would still be a single three-letter line.* </p>
<p>Well I'm excited to share that I added my honest-to-God-first-actual-leisure-travel destination to the list: Iceland.</p>
<p>My plan of record was (and continues to be) to save up, retire early, and travel for some indeterminable amount of time, but that doesn't mean the road to retirement needs to stay stuck in the States. Plus, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/charting-the-waters/5689792285114368">reading about all of the potential journeys I could take</a> made my travel trigger finger a bit itchy, so when <a href="http://www.theflightdeal.com/2016/06/01/wow-air-400-san-francisco-reykjavik-iceland-roundtrip-including-all-taxes/">$400 round trip tickets to Reykjavik, Iceland</a> appeared, I <em>had to</em> bite the bullet (excuse the poor combination of expressions) and book the trip.</p>
<h2>Preparing for the trip</h2>
<p>It's not a huge secret that <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-art-of-not-buying-things/5718532058775552">I don't have a lot of stuff</a>. I've got a bed, a dresser, and about a week's worth of clothes. For reference, here's a recent picture of my closet:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XJao7ha-6imPiudRBkJlr5JTTy9HQZzixVqtBb3Y2YMyMNK9admrnvykVKDdw074XJ93X2t0E_PRnUbvbyhgiPe7HdwwDGO-ijLo=s300"/>
<p>Not a lot going on in there.</p>
</div>
<p>One thing worth noting is that my wardrobe is unarguably meant for California weather. After all, it's  one of the <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-perfect-storm/5738600293466112">main reasons</a> I can do what I do. I've got a light sweatshirt and a pullover, but I'd still probably be a Brancicle** in Iceland wearing both of them together. Not only was winter coming, but <em>I</em> was heading for winter. <em>Real</em> winter no less, none of this Bay area oh-man-it's-dropped-below-sixty-it's-so-cold "winter".</p>
<p>So I started entertaining the idea of how to go about getting real winter gear. Did I want to borrow it from a friend? Should I find a place to rent it? Should I just buy some cheap stuff and dispose of it after? After all, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/tips-from-the-truck-3-consolidation--defragmentation/5704837555552256">truck space</a> <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/taking-inventory/5701867585667072">is limited</a>. I had to think about this a little bit, and I did a bit of consulting with my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-art-of-not-buying-things/5718532058775552">past self</a> and Thoreau's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden">Walden</a></em>. One thing that stuck with me from <em>Walden</em> (not that I've finished it yet) is the idea that if you are going to buy something, make sure it's high-quality. That way, instead of saving a little bit of cash in the short term buying something cheap that needs to be replaced regularly, spend a little bit more and make it last for life. This makes sense, and looking forward, I knew I'd be going to Boston (for Christmas), Z&#252;rich (for business), and Alaska (with friends) over the next few months, so I'd clearly be getting a lot of use out of whatever winter gear I bought. After a bit of review-reading and shopping around, I ended up buying a few things to start my winter wardrobe.</p>

</div>
<p>In total, I spent around $1,000 on winter gear. Not cheap for sure, but still less than a month's rent for a shared apartment in South Bay. Plus, it's unlikely I'll ever have to buy any of these things ever again. And now for the end result, a happy, unfrozen Brandon:</p>

<h2>Travel Philosophy</h2>
<p>Since this was my first time traveling for no other reason than my own amusement and edification, I didn't really know what I was doing. I definitely had an idealized version of what travel should look like, but outside of that, I was pretty clueless.</p>
<p>To me, travelling isn't about collecting selfies to show off where you've been to people who couldn't care less. It's about learning, and experiencing something new.  There's this <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/media/releases/2005/pr050727.cfm">natural human tendency</a> we have to surround ourselves with people like us, which probably explains why my Facebook feed is an echo chamber for all of the things I want to hear. Unfortunately, that's not how you actually learn anything, or grow as a person. You learn stuff by stepping outside your bubble and looking at things from a new perspective. All of the interesting perspectives are hiding in other people's heads, and the vast majority of those people don't live in Mountain View, California.</p>
<p>Another thing that I'd been thinking about is how, more often than I'd like, I find myself worrying that I'm not living in the moment, that I'm mindlessly going with the ebbs and flows of my daily routine, than my headphones are buried too far into my head too often, which in turn is buried too far into some shifting racket of pixels. I worry that if I don't make a conscious effort to <em>be alive</em>, I'll just be mechanically going through the motions and I'll wake up one day shocked to find out that I'm old and had blindly let life pass me by. I know, I've had <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-quest-for-arbitrary-milestones-/5767494685949952">this particular flavor of existential crisis</a> before (and it's pretty much the plot of the movie <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_(2006_film)">Click</a></em>), but it's not entirely unfounded. <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/why-does-time-fly-as-we-get-older/">Research</a> shows that time seems to go faster as we age because our brains don't even bother forming long-term memories for our cookie-cutter daily routines. Getting back to the topic at hand, all I'm trying to say is that when I started travelling, I wanted to make sure I was living in the moment and really experiencing it, as opposed to passively observing it, particularly through the potato-quality camera on my phone, but I'll come back to that later.</p>
<h2>Ice and Fire</h2>
<p>So let's talk about Iceland. I knew almost nothing about the country before I left, having done a downright pitiful amount of research beforehand. Iceland was first settled by Vikings around the 9th century, which fits right in with my preconception of the Vikings as hardy badasses who looked frosty death in the face and laughed heartily. At some point in 11th century, everyone adopted Christianity, though locals tell me the real religion of Iceland is <strong>The Church of The Almighty Lamb Hotdog</strong>, with houses of worship on every corner.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M0SDlta_9mov3UEBGuJr8u4gCVDT3MKtAmY-OvNJiicHZTDfrYm4FNLDwMkoTZLYcyX9g8_XPOOgy6aGRiIVx_YVNW3z6YqkB9AL1w=s400"/>
<p>The hotdogs have crunchy onions and some green Mayo-esque substance. They taste amazing, and I'm not proud of the fact that I averaged more than one per day.</p>
</div>
<p> Culturally, Iceland is super interesting, especially if you're from a more mainstream first-world Western country. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22288564">Nearly a third</a> of the population owns guns, but the police don't carry them, and on average, there's <a href="http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2015/05/13/iceland_3rd_lowest_murder_rate/">less than one fatal homicide per year</a>. It probably has something to do with the fact that 97% of the population identifies as "middle class". Other factoids on the highlight reel include that Iceland runs almost entirely on renewable energy, mainly geothermal. Ooh, and <a href="http://www.worldfinance.com/infrastructure-investment/government-policy/failing-banks-winning-economy-the-truth-about-icelands-recovery">Iceland's economy</a> is dominated by the fishing industry, and more recently, tourism. I remember reading on the plane that during peak tourism season in 2017, there will be more tourists than Icelandic residents (&gt;300,000).</p>
<div class="inline-image">

</div>
<p>Aside from history and random factoids, the entire country looks like a tourism ad. It's stupidly photogenic. It's got giant glaciers, active volcanoes, stunning waterfalls, hike-able ice caves, unique architecture and so much more. At times, it's easy to believe you're on a different planet. Here's a random potpourri of photos:</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>So, having completed my first international mini-vacation, it's time to reflect and see what I learned, not just about Iceland, but about myself. Unsurprisingly, I met a ton of wonderful people, locals and tourists alike, from a whole variety of interesting backgrounds, and had the opportunity to acquaint myself with an array of languages, foods, customs, and cultures. I saw the Northern Lights, ate and drank local delicacies, learned a few Icelandic words, and toured some of the most awe-inspiring natural sights I could imagine.</p>
<p>More personally, I learned to balance out my travel idealism with a bit of practicality. It's nice to want to live in the moment and appreciate things for yourself, but that shouldn't preclude documenting the journey. I've noted before that I keep this blog because I have a Swiss-cheese memory, and writing these posts is how I make sure I remember all of this. Well, the same goes for travelling. Watching the sun set on a black sand beach and taking in the beauty of the moment <strong>isn't</strong> mutually-exclusive with memorializing it in a photo. Stuck in my own idealism, I failed to realize that, and didn't really take any photos. Were it not for my travel companion, my future self would have no way of reliving this adventure, and it was definitely unfair of me to leave that burden on them. Without them, this post would certainly be less interesting, and missing most of Iceland's unique character. So I guess I learned a bit about how to <em>actually</em> travel, which I'll put to use on future excursions.</p>
<p> More than anything, I'm looking forward to seeing where I end up next.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">Just for completeness, the whole list would be:<ol><li>USA</li></ol>&#8230;and nothing else.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of the words Brandon and Icicle.</em></p>

<p>I've had <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-aftermath/5655608640405504">a few opportunities</a> to learn that I definitely shouldn't read comments about me (or anything really) on the Internet, but sometimes morbid curiosity gets the better of me. Firmly not learning from the past, I found myself sifting through a hundred or so of these Internet comments earlier today. The general consensus seemed to be that I'm wasting my life and I'm wrong for living in a truck.</p>
<p class="text-center">But that really confused me, because I don't live in a truck.</p>
<p class="text-center">You wanna know where I live?</p>
<p><em>I live</em> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_Rock_Beach">Goat Rock</a>, where I went outdoor rock climbing for the first time today with a few friends. I watched deer dart back and forth across a hillside while I was hanging from a boulder, slicing my hands sliding against rough rocks.</p>
<p><em>I live</em> on a hundred miles of biking trails, sometimes for hours at a time. I ride along highways and over bridges and beside marshes and anywhere that my bike is willing to take me. Sometimes I don't even know where I want to end up.</p>
<p><em>I live</em> at the Shoreline Amphitheatre, and the Fox Theatre, The Independent, The Regency Ballroom, and half a dozen other random venues, where I dance around like an idiot and belt my heart out to my favorite bands.</p>
<p><em>I live</em> on a picnic blanket in a bunch of different local parks, where my girlfriend and I take turns reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)"><em>The Martian</em></a> to each other and playing fetch with her tiny, adorable dog.</p>
<p><em>I live</em> at the gym, because I always want to be healthier and stronger and faster, and I'm at my happiest when I'm improving.</p>
<p><em>I live</em> in a handful of small coffee shops, where I hack away at a hundred different side projects and read because life is too short to not know stuff.</p>
<p class="text-center">I just <em>sleep</em> in a truck. <em>Living</em> is what happens when you wake up.</p>

<p>I feel like it's been a while since I started a new series of posts. Sure, we've got <a href="">Truck Tech</a> and <a href="">Home Improvement</a> and <a href="">Tips from the Truck</a> and <a href="">Q &amp; A</a>, but I'm pretty confident we have room for <em>at least</em> one more. If titles weren't supposed to be short, I'd probably extend the series name to: <strong>Incredibly Obvious Facts About Box Trucks (And Their Implications)</strong>, just so we're all definitely on the same page. Anyway, these posts will be all about inherent properties of box trucks, and what that means for how I structure and live my life. Our first patently obvious fact about box trucks: they definitely don't have bathrooms.</p>
<p class="text-center">To illustrate the above obvious fact, here's a recent* picture of the box.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vyKm2Nvmcz4IBi7bTDhS6MitTkOeko2R7QzbGipRVBXgq8zpuSTsISkUgGhmAzpcC22P6HJcXRF60YsA6aDdF-1fZgLJ39M3lgyG=s500"/>
<p>Not a single bathroom in sight.</p>
</div>
<p>Box trucks are well-suited to a wide range of activities. Need to make an area more sketchy? Park a box truck there and watch the surrounding property values plummet.** Worried you don't own enough things covered in graffiti? Buy a box truck, they're magnets for impromptu community art sessions. Got some stuff to move? I know seven satisfied customers who can testify that Brandon's Ad Hoc Moving Service&#8482; comes in handy on occasion. Box trucks are great for hauling crap around&#8230;just not in the literal sense.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the (decidedly unglamorous) topic at hand: my home of choice doesn't have a bathroom. But what does that mean? Well, I've already talked at length (arguably too much) about <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/search?query=bathroom">the implications of not having a nearby bathroom</a>, so we'll gloss over that part. Basically, it's not a huge deal because I'm never in the truck except when I'm sleeping. It does change how I <em>think</em> about bathrooms though. It's not a room in my house where I keep my hygiene-related stuff. For me, it's any place where I can get myself ready for starting or ending a day. This is what my bathroom looks like:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HDghGETug88Xalk6rW_sYQslcx9O9aohNTtTamwnxAsjf2DHLdJN-isLFA4xxteD3TYAA43pW76-V2z1SLw_04pgnThV2hdTVpo=s400"/>
<p>Sure, there's no marble countertops or glass walls, but it gets the job done.</p>
</div>
<p class="text-center">Or from a few other (equally unflattering) angles.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dwNOlmnxtpu0EUfdHVfOzKKx1fFbrxtPCtlbWRBiSS4JnOpDMSObYtQvtar2x2zzd3nT1V5f3paF2_7m9skIPo1kw1IRUef50m0=s300"/>

<p>I own more <a href="http://www.axe.us/">Axe&#174;</a> products than a prepubescent boy preparing for his first date.<br/>For the record, I'm neither of those things.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Uh Brandon, I know you're slowly losing your mind and all, but that's definitely a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081JG2T0">travel bag</a>&#8230;not a bathroom.</em></p>
<p>Why not both? That bag has everything I need to not look/smell*** like I live in a truck, just add water. And really, it's hardly any less convenient than a personal bathroom would be. In fact, it's definitely got a few perks. For one, normal bathrooms are hands-down the worst part of a house to clean. Aside from the general uncleanliness that pervades bathrooms by their very nature, they also have that whole Portal to Hell&#8482;-area going on behind the toilet. When was the last time anyone willing stared into that abyss? Never. Seriously, that place is a straight-up war zone, with different gangs of bacteria and mold-like creatures fighting for turf. There are more unclassified species back there than in the Amazon. I'm downright joyful that I don't have to fight that battle.</p>
<p>That's not to say I'm just pawning off cleaning and making it someone else's problem though. I'm an ardent subscriber of the whole "Leave things better than you found them" philosophy, and always make sure to clean up after myself and then some. For example, and I'll never understand this, but for some reason people love to strew their gym towels haphazardly around the locker room on Friday nights. When I come in on Saturday morning, it looks like a washing machine projectile vomited all over the place. Or like a bomb went off in the laundry bin. In any case, I'll usually take a few of them and toss them in the actual towel receptacle (a mere three feet away) on my way out the door. It's certainly not the most heroic act ever committed, but it stops me from feeling like my questionable life choices are to the detriment of others.</p>
<p>The only (incredibly minor) downside is that no bathroom means no mirror, meaning the first time I see my ugly mug is after I've subjected everyone else to it at the gym. When I stroll into the gym with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17hPCHLMpyM">Beyonc&#233;</a> blaring, I quite literally <a href="http://genius.com/2549762">"woke up like this"</a>.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I've gotten rid of the wood, extra insulation, and tire since I took this photo. I also built the <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/qa-8-cleaning-out-the-closet/5681097123823616">previously pictured</a> coat rack for my shirts.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">Unfortunately, this doesn't work in the Bay Area.</em></p>
<p>***<em class="small">I don't know if the truck has a scent or not. If it does, it's certainly not the one I want to smell like.</em></p>

<p>As of me typing these words, my little truck experiment has been going on for over a year and four months.  That's been more than enough time to see a thousand different questions fly through this site and my inbox, and every so often I'll sit down and <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Q+%26+A">answer a few of them</a>. But there's one question that I haven't answered, and can't seem to escape. It's usually one of the first questions to come up in conversation, and half a bazillion variations of it are sitting in my queue:</p>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>How realistic is it to live in a truck for the next 10 years?</strong></em></p>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>How long will you continue to live in the truck?</strong></em></p>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>Are you going to use your savings to make a down payment on a house?</strong></em></p>
<p class="text-center"><em><strong>Are you comfortable living in a truck indefinitely?</strong></em></p>
<p>You get the idea. Basically, people want to know when the hell I'm going to get my shenanigans together and be a normal, functioning member of society. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I've been avoiding the question, it's just that I've never had a good answer. Normally I'll say something like:</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>"Whenever the truck stops making sense."</strong></p>
<p>Standing alone, that answer is pretty useless, and I definitely don't have enough of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesuke_Miyagi">Mr. Miyagi</a> swagger to make it sound sagacious or insightful. But anyway, this post is all about figuring out <em>just</em> how truck-filled my future could be.</p>
<p>If you've been following along with my <del>story</del> disjointed ramblings for a little while, you probably have a pretty good sense by now that I have literally no idea what I'm doing. At all. Sure, I <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-plan/5668600916475904">plan</a> things out sometimes, but I hardly ever consider how to piece it all together. I'm just kinda playing things by ear: trying to live as simply as I can, attempting to figure out what I want out of life, and deciding what happiness means to me. So it's fair to say that I haven't put a ton of thought into a timeline for migrating out of the truck and into a more permanent crash pad. In my defense though, the actual "migrating out of the truck" part would take all of 10 minutes. But anyway, to figure out how long it makes sense to stay in the truck, let's go back to the beginning, to figure out how we even ended up here.</p>
<h2>Beginnings</h2>
<p>When I started this adventure, all I knew was that it didn't make a lot of sense for me to get an apartment. I'd spent a summer out here two years ago, and from that experience, I could confidently say that I'd rarely be home. Plus I consider traffic a form of torture and I'd rather spend my money building stupid things, like <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-project-5-the-bike-rack-bites-back/5735735550279680">bike racks</a> and <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/decimals-and-dollars-planning-the-next-decade/5669283816275968">my future</a>. So this was the logical <del>conclusion</del> extreme, and I bit the bullet betting that this lifestyle would be simpler, without actually sacrificing my happiness or anything else I cared about. <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-year-inside-the-box/5763418761986048">And I like to think it's paid off.</a> So as weird as it is, the truck just <em>made sense</em> for me, given where my priorities were (and still are). There's not really an endgame; as long as my goals stay the same and the truck remains a valid tool for achieving them, I'll stick with it.</p>
<h2>So... how long will <em>that</em> be?</h2>
<p>If we're looking for a milestone that makes sense to stop with all this truck business, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/moving-out-the-wild-west/5647308616105984">losing my go-to parking spot</a> probably would have been as good a time as any to call it quits. <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/indebted/5690820929781760">Clearing out my student loans</a> would have been a satisfying high-note to end on, and rounding out <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-year-inside-the-box/5763418761986048">an entire year in the box</a> would have worked too.</p>
<p>More recently, someone asked me how my retirement nest egg is doing, because the savings clock only shows how much money I'd have saved over a hypothetical apartment. Between the <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/of-trucks-and-tax-advantaged-accounts/5671321778257920">various retirement accounts</a>, I just broke into six-figure territory a week or two ago (semi-independently confirmed by <a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a>). $100,000 is a nice round number, why not call it a day, drive my truck up to the city, and toss my bed and dresser into a respectable studio apartment? Hell, why not take those savings and put a down payment on a house? Why am I still spending my slumbers surrounded on six sides by an super-sized sardine can?</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Well, because it still makes sense.</strong></p>
<p>While a lot of stuff has changed over the past year, that hasn't. And if after two years, or five years, the truck still maintains all the properties that originally drew me to it, I'll still be here. It's weird though, because on the other hand, there's actually very little that keeps me from abandoning it at any given second. For example, if I went back and found some huge hairy mutant <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/pest-problems/5759778777202688">spider</a> in the truck tonight, there's a 96.4% chance I'd never sleep in it again.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'll go back one night and find it burned to the ground in some freak accident. I honestly don't even think it'd be a big deal. I mean, what would I really be losing? A bed and a week's worth of clothes? Hardly worth ruining a perfectly good day over.</p>
<p>But let's assume for a second that the mutant spiders only come out while I'm sleeping, and the truck doesn't burst into flames on a whim. What do I think the plan will look like?</p>
<h2>The Closest Thing to a Plan</h2>
<p>There's always this implicit assumption in every question about my future plans: that I'll be moving into an apartment/house at some point. But, if everything goes to plan, it'll be the exact opposite. I've talked pretty seriously about spending the rest of my life <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Travel">traveling</a>, so let's take that as a given and see where we're at.</p>
<p>Through that lens, the truck feels more like a stepping stone, a transition phase. In the same way that college is a transition from living at home to living in the real world<sup><sup>ideally</sup></sup>, the truck is a transition from living in a singular, fixed place to living everywhere&#8230;and nowhere at all. Becoming sufficiently comfortable with the truck, my next home will ideally be nothing more than a backpack. I'll hop around the world as passports and seasons and retirement monies allow, staying in hostels and exploring the places that words in my travel books couldn't possibly do justice.</p>
<p class="text-center">So long story short, I don't know how long the truck will be a part of my life, but I'll enjoy it while it lasts.</p>

<em>Source: <span>My actual "closet", aka a pipe bolted across the back of the truck. And it only took me 6 months to finish.</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>It's that time again, when I realize that I've been neglecting people's questions for too long and they've reached a critical mass. It's time to clean out the closet. Not the literal one pictured above, though I should probably do a write up for how I threw that together too.</p>
<p><em><strong>I just read <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/mini-home-improvement-1-arts-and-crafts/5730192894984192">your leather strap solution</a> to your drawer problem. Have you considered magnets?</strong></em></p>
<p>Indeed I had, and in fact I use some neodymium magnets to hold a makeshift screen onto my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/home-improvement-project-7-let-there-be-light-and-heat-and-stuff/5694639155707904">sunroof</a>. I decided against using magnets on the dresser drawers because of their force characteristics. Basically, I didn't like the idea that I'd have to Goldilocks my way to the right strength of magnet: too weak and the drawers do as they please when I take turns, too strong and they become difficult to open, not to mention they might rip the super glue off instead of simply separating. Snaps and straps are much easier to reason about: I snap them closed and the drawers don't move, I unsnap them and I can get at my clothes freely, without a fight.</p>
<p><em><strong>I'd like to see a widget on the site that provides the current temperature inside the box. Or perhaps a temperature readout associated with the posts you make while inside the box. Basically, interested to see the temperature range and what the temperature drops to overnight in the winter.</strong></em></p>
<p>That would be an interesting project. Get a little solar panel, a Raspberry Pi or Arduino, temperature sensor, and cell modem, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)">POST</a> some data to the site every few minutes. I mean, I'm not going to <em>actually</em> do it, but I agree, it'd be interesting. How about a pretty good approximation though? The box truck may very well be an oven during the day, but I'm only ever in it at night, and the truck has basically zero functional insulation. At night, the temperature outside is the temperature inside, with maybe a degree or two difference, so checking the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=south%20bay%20weather">weather in South Bay</a> will let you know how the box is doin'. To keep warm in "winter", I usually just pull a blanket or two over and that does the trick. I put winter in quotes because, as someone from a place with actual seasons, what happens in the Bay Area hardly qualifies.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is physical address verification required for mailbox renewal?</strong></em></p>
<p>You know, I really can't remember. I don't think so. Every six months when I go to renew my private mailbox, I swipe my card and that's usually the end of it. When I initially got the mailbox, there were definitely things to read and papers to sign, but I don't think I had to verify any other addresses, just provide a previous one.</p>
<p><em><strong>You've talked about retiring and retiring early, so clearly the future is on your mind. Are you considering having a family ever/are your calculations based on providing for you alone?</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a great question, even though the future is scary and I act like a small child. My ramblings at the end of <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/a-taste-of-tomorrow/5734977488551936">this post</a> explain it more thoroughly, but my strategy for the future is just to create as many opportunities for myself now, so that when the time comes to make Serious Adult Decisions&#8482; (or SAD, for short), I have the flexibility to do what I want. You're right, my early retirement math gets a lot easier when it's just me, but I'm also not na&#239;ve enough to think that I know what I'll be like ten years from now. Do I want kids? Who knows. No doubt, there's certainly something attractive about the idea of tiny genetic hybrids of you and someone you think is awesome. That said, I'm fortunate enough to have the luxury of not needing to decide if that's what I want right now. One thing I'll say is that if I did "settle down", I highly doubt future-me would accept the traditional way of doing it. I'm not saying there'd be trucks involved, but there'd definitely still be a whole lot of travelling and something resembling retirement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Can you please elude to your eating habits? Do you have a small kitchen, grill, mini fridge in the box? Are you going out to eat more often? Lastly, monthly food expense (approx), thanks!</strong></em></p>
<p>The truck has zero kitchens, grills, and/or mini-fridges. In fact, the truck has zero anythings that aren't beds and/or dressers. I eat three square meals a day at work, and I go out on the weekends. I spend $50-75 a weekend on food, so probably ~$300/month. My diet consists of copious amounts of chicken, with some veggies thrown in for decoration.</p>
<p><em><strong>Any plans to fix up the inside, like removing the garage door and putting in a wall with a camper-style door&#8230;or anything for the walls? It's looking pretty grim in there, man.</strong></em></p>
<p>I've considered putting in drywall or replacing the rear gate, but I invariably end up asking myself the same question: why? Let's be honest with ourselves here, no amount of drywall or renovation is going to make up for the fact that it's a sketchy old moving van. I can put a new coat of paint on it, I can redo the floors in beautifully-finished hardwood, I can hang up paintings&#8212;you get the idea, but it'll still be the same truck. Something something lipstick on a pig. I chose the truck because I was indifferent to appearances and all I needed was a bed and a place to store my clothes. Everything else is superfluous. If I cared about how grim it looked or what people thought of it, it's unlikely I'd have ever gotten a truck (or even an RV) in the first place. The truck serves its function and it serves it well, so it's hard to justify putting in the money, time, and effort to make any "improvements" which do nothing to make me <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-art-of-not-buying-things/5718532058775552">a happier, healthier person</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thoughts on something like an RV park?</strong></em></p>
<p>I very briefly looked into it after my unceremonious (but not unexpected or unwarranted) <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/moving-out-the-wild-west/5647308616105984">eviction</a>. The conclusion I came to is that no RV park would want me and my MacGyver'd shanty. As it stands, the truck doesn't have much in common with an RV: it doesn't have electricity, water, or the hookups to provide them. Even if a particularly open-minded RV park was willing to take me under their wing, it'd likely be a non-zero distance from my work, negating all of my nice <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/commuting-a-normal-perspective/5692201761767424">commuting</a> <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/traffic-and-tribulations/5651442522128384">benefits</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I've gotten into this wonderful rhythm of publishing posts that are tragically untimely. My <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5701867585667072">Spring Cleaning post</a> was five days too late, I'd had the insulation and skylight for weeks before I'd <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5694639155707904">recounted the tale</a>, and I'd successfully <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5651874166341632">picked up and put down</a> my weight goals way before I picked up the pen and put down a post. So it's only fitting that I'm just getting around to talking about a feature I added to the site over eight months ago.</p>
<p>Every so often, I get bored and fidgety and change things around on the site. Sometimes I'll tweak the <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5764640680181760">savings calculation</a>, sometimes I'll move around items on the mobile layout, and yet other times I'll sit down with a coffee and some music and plop a <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5766466041282560">few new features</a> into existence. The title and picture probably provide plenty perspective, but this time around, I added email subscriptions. I noted in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5721036024709120">this post</a> (a relative eternity ago) that I was thinking about adding them because, in theory, it's pretty simple. Someone gives me their email address and clicks a button, then they get an email every time I write a new post. Unfortunately, like pretty much every problem I've sized up thus far, it wasn't nearly as simple as I was expecting, and I definitely hit a few snags along the way.</p>
<p>Forewarning: this is another post for my fellow nerds. For anyone else, it's a valid substitute for a tranquilizer.</p>
<h2>The Nitty Grity Technical Details</h2>
<p>Depending on <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5721036024709120">how closely</a> you've been following my various love affairs with <a href="https://golang.org/">trendy</a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs">web</a> <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">technologies</a>, you may or may not know that my site runs on Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs">App Engine</a> platform. Knowing very little about how email works, it logically seemed like the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/mail/">App Engine Mail API documentation</a>  could maybe potentially be a good place to start. The more I read though, the more foreign concepts I wandered across. What is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/mail/#Go_Authenticating_mail_DKIM">DKIM</a>? How does <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786">SPF work</a>? Do I need an alias? Whose SMTP server am I using? I started to wonder, <em>how bad do I really want email subscriptions anyway?</em> But I, with ample hesitation, plodded down the path anyway.</p>
<h3>DKIM</h3>
<p>The ideas behind <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124">DKIM</a> are pretty similar to the ones that power TLS and consequently all the important things that happen on the Internet. My understanding of DKIM is that, like, you have a DNS record saying "Yo, this is my public key, use it if you want to see if an email from me is legit" and anyone can see that when they look up records for your domain name (FromInsideTheBox.com in my case). Then, every time I send a message [at] frominsidethebox [dot] com, AppEngine adds a special magic signature in the header that's signed with the corresponding private key, and the recipient can use the public key to verify that the signature makes sense and thus the email must have really been sent by me. Cool stuff.</p>
<h3>SPF</h3>
<p>Turns out it's not just for sunscreen anymore. SPF works kind of like DKIM, minus all of the fancy encryption stuff. SPF works by adding another DNS record, but this one says "Bro, if you get a message from my buddy App Engine, you can trust it, he's chill." This way, you can send mail from someone else's mail server and still show that it can be trusted.</p>
<p>At this point, you may be wondering a few things, like <em>Why are all of these things necessary?</em> and <em>Why is Brandon personifying computing protocols and making them sound like frat bros?</em> To answer the former question (and ignore the latter), it's because the Internet is a giant pile of dusty, wobbling, unstable, duct-taped together systems stacked on top of each other like some shoddy version of digital Jenga. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">underlying protocol</a> for sending emails reared its head in 1982, and offered literally no way to authenticate where the messages are coming from. It makes sense, it evolved at a time when the "Internet" consisted entirely of academics and the military, so you could just trust the network. It wasn't like some drunk researcher was going to send prank emails, like:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>From:</strong> Ronald Reagan &lt;rreagan@whitehouse.gov&gt;</div>
<div><strong>To:</strong> Alexander Haig &lt;ahaig@whitehouse.gov&gt;</div>
<div><strong>Subject:</strong> fire the nukes</div>
<div><strong>Date:</strong> April 1, 1985</div>
<br/>
Ay Hags,
<br/><br/>
Launch one of those suckers at the moon, I wanna make it rain nacho cheese.
<br/><br/>
LOL,<br/>
Ya boy El Prezzo
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>...so yeah. That'd definitely be a problem today, thus DKIM and SPF.</p>
<h2>CAN SPAM</h2>
<p>There was one other acronym I had forgotten to take into consideration: CAN SPAM. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003">CAN SPAM</a> is a US law signed in 2003. It's also the reason all of the (legitimate) emails you get have an "Unsubscribe" link. Not wanting to be at the mercy of the US Government (well, any more than my taxes already cause me to be), I figured it prudent to add one of these "Unsubscribe" links myself. That takes <em>work</em> and <em>effort</em> though, now we're not just blindly (and indefinitely) sending out emails to anyone who sends me an address. Instead, now we have to maintain an active database, and remove people when they ask.</p>
<p>I'm making this sound harder and more complicated than it actually was. All I had to do was add a few web endpoints, and add a new type to my <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/datastore/reference">Datastore</a>. The end code (removing the extra boring parts) looked something like:</p>
<div class="text-center">
<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
<pre class="blog-code">
<code class="golang" style="padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px;">// Email actions

func confirmationHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  address := strings.TrimSpace(r.PostFormValue("email"))

  // Do a few basic validations

  exists, err := db.EMailExists(address)
  if err != nil || exists{
    // Return an error
  }

  id, err := db.CreateEMail(address)

}

func subscribeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  id, err := strconv.ParseInt(r.FormValue("key"), 10, 64)
  if err != nil {
    // Uh oh, looks like nobody is subscribing today
  }

  if err := db.ConfirmEMail(id); err != nil {
    // Experiencing some technical difficulties
  }

  render(w, BasicTemplate{

    Type:        "success",
  })
}

// Someone doesn't want my ramblings in their inbox anymore
func unsubscribeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  id, err := strconv.ParseInt(r.FormValue("key"), 10, 64)
  if err != nil {
    // Uh oh, they aren't going to like this
  }

  if err := db.DeleteEMail(id); err != nil {
    // Looks like they're stuck with me until I learn how to program better
  }

 render(w, BasicTemplate{
    Description: "Your subscription has been removed.",
    Header:      "You're all set!",
    Message:     "Good to go.",
    Type:        "success",
  })
}

// The struct used to hold subscriptions
type Subscription struct {

  Added     time.Time
  ID        int64 `datastore:"-"`
}

<p><em>Woah Brandon, when did you add highlighted code snippets to the site?!</em></p>
<p>I'm glad you noticed, hypothetical reader! I added it a few months ago, but this is the first post to actually utilize it. It uses <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> behind the scenes, and took like five lines of code to set up. But I'm getting sidetracked here. As for the code above, that's really all I needed to satisfy the CAN SPAM act requirements, all in all not too bad. Granted, that doesn't include the code for actually sending emails, but we're getting there.</p>
<h2>Actually Sending Mail</h2>
<p>Okay, so at this point in the narrative, we've set up DKIM and SPF to work with App Engine, and we've got a storage system set up for subscriptions. According to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/mail/">the documentation</a>, all we need to do now is add:</p>
<div class="text-center">
<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
<pre class="blog-code">
<code class="golang" style="padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px;">subs, err := db.Subscriptions(ctx)
if err != nil {
  // Looks like no emails are going out today
}

for _, sub := range subs {
  data := struct {
    ID int64
  }{
    sub.ID,
  }
  var buf bytes.Buffer
  if err := emailTemplate.ExecuteTemplate(&amp;buf, "new_post.html", data); err != nil {
    // Guess we're not sending this one
  }
  mail.Send(ctx, &amp;mail.Message{
    Sender: "post-notifier@frominsidethebox.com",
    To: sub.Address,
    Subject: "New Post on From Inside The Box: " + post.Title,
    Body: buf.String(),
  })
}
</code>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hook that up to some <em>authenticated</em> web endpoint, pass in the post ID as a parameter, and boom, you've got a working subscription system. Shockingly enough, that's pretty much all it took to get working. Not only did it work, it worked on (nearly) the first try, no less. In fact, it was <em>so</em> easy that I was sure something would break in the not-too-distant future, as my experience with trucks and things and life in general has shown me to be universally true.</p>
<h3>Mistake #1: Not Reading the Manual</h3>
<p>A bit of background: I have a special button I push when I want to send out emails to subscribers. It's <em>separate</em> from the special button for publishing posts, because in the event that I accidentally publish something too early, I'd rather not spam everyone with my half-baked ramblings. And if anything goes wrong in the email-sending process after I push my special button, the server will return a message. For a month or two, this process worked well. Things were going along swimmingly, and then one time I pushed the special email button, and things stopped swimming. I got an error that of my 106 subscription emails, 6 of them didn't send.</p>
<p>Huh, that's a bit suspicious, exactly 100 emails sent successfully...</p>
<p>After the slightest bit of sleuthing, I found out that App Engine has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas#Mail">some limits and quotas</a>, a particualrly relevant one being that I can't send more than 100 emails a day. This works fine when &#8804;100 people are subscribed, but not so well when 106 people are subscribed. Sorry to the 6 people who didn't receive an email when I put up <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5767494685949952">this post</a>, unfortunately my logging was also bad enough that I didn't know <em>which</em> six subscribers didn't get a letter, so the best thing I could do was fix the problem for the future. Enter stage right, <a href="http://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a>.</p>
<p>SendGrid is a mail-delivery service. They do lots of other things too, but those aren't quite as relevant or interesting to me. All I care about was that they'd happily send <strong>way</strong> more than 100 emails. So I ripped out the App Engine mailing code, and pulled in SendGrid's Go client library. It took about an hour to throw together, and the only real difference is that I have to pass the SendGrid API key, which I embed directly in my code because I have no sense for design or regard for security.*</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Just Generally Being Incompetent</h3>
<p>If you look at the mail snippet above, you might notice one teensy little problem, mainly that I'm just iterating over all the subscriptions and making a <strong>blocking</strong> call to send a message. This is fine when you only have a few users, but it scales linearly with the number of subscriptions. Not only that, but most of the time spent sending each message is waiting for the request to trot off to The Internet At Large&#8482; and mosey on back. This is a shame, because Go has all these fancy concurrency primitives that I'm not taking advantage of, and would be particularly well-suited to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a> problem. Using goroutines, we can fire off all the requests, which will then do all that waiting in the background. Similar to my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/truck-tech-talk/5721036024709120">last performance post</a>, it means we can send all of the emails in (almost, kinda sort if you squint a little bit) constant time, instead of watching it get slower as I get more subscribers.</p>
<p>Sounds great right? Well it would be if I was a less shoddy programmer. Concurrency can be tricky to get right (even in a language built for it) if you aren't being careful, and I wasn't thinking. Here's the problem: each email is slightly different because the unsubscribe link has a unique ID for each subscriber, so I can't fire off the same email for everyone. See if you can spot where I went wrong in this first implementation:</p>
<div class="text-center">
<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
<pre class="blog-code">
<code class="golang" style="padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px;">var buf bytes.Buffer
data := struct {
  Unsub  int64
  PostID int64
  Desc   string
}{
  0,
  post.ID,
  post.Desc(),
}

var wg sync.WaitGroup
// Iterate over list of subscribers
for _, email := range emails {
  wg.Add(1)
  go func(email *EMail) {
    defer wg.Done()
    data.Unsub = email.ID
    if err := emailTemplate.ExecuteTemplate(&amp;buf, "new_post.html", data); err != nil {
      // Always check your errors kids
    }

    message := sendgrid.NewMail()
    // Build the rest of the message here

    if err := sg.Send(message); err != nil {
      // Log the errors and whatnot
    }

    buf.Reset()
  }(email)
}
// Wait for all the emails to be sent
wg.Wait()
</code>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>...did you see the <del><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo">gorilla</a></del> mistake? I thought I was being clever by using one buffer for the emails to save memory, but I was really setting myself up for an awful and awfully obvious race condition by writing to the same buffer from 100 different goroutines with no synchronization whatsoever. The end result could have been a number of problems of varying unpleasantness, but what happened, in reality, was that every person got an email containing the emails for <strong>EVERYONE</strong> concatenated together. Aside from just looking silly, it means that anyone who got one of those emails could have (and still can) click each and every one of the unsubscribe links in the email and unsubscribe &gt;100 people from my mailing list. I greatly appreciate everyone continuing to not do that, but I regularly back up the mailing list just in case.</p>
<p>The first thing I did to fix this was to give each goroutine its own buffer. Then, I wrote some beefy unit and integration tests for the mailing system. Once I was satisfied with the passing tests, I ripped out all the mailing code, and replaced it with a pool of mailer threads that get fed subscriber IDs via a channel. That way, I only need as many buffers as workers in the pool. The first few attempts caused the tests to fail for one reason or another (malformed message bodies, deadlocks, etc), but I eventually got it working. I'm going to skip including that code, because this post is already probably too long, but you get the idea.</p>
<h2>Last Thing: TLS</h2>
<p>All this talk of email is great, but there was one oversight on my part that I'd been avoiding because it was convenient to do so. My site was being served over HTTP, not HTTPS, so if you clicked the "Subscribe" button, it'd be sending your email address over the open Internet. Not a huge deal, but it's 2016 and I can do better than that. So with that in mind (and a bit of prodding from a friend), I started looking up the process for getting TLS on a custom domain with App Engine. I also wasn't ecstatic about the idea of paying a signing authority for a certificate, so I looked into <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>. I ended up finding a few great guides on <a href="http://blog.seafuj.com/lets-encrypt-on-google-app-engine">how to set it all up</a>, then I just had to switch my image serving over to HTTPS, and add a "secure: true" in my App Engine app.yaml configuration so that it would always redirect to the HTTPS version of the site and that was it! I don't know about you, but the green lock in the address bar gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">I'm joking, of course. What kind of idiot would mix credentials with code? Kidding again, I'm that kind of idiot and that's exactly what I do, but I swear I have every intention of having a separate Datastore table to store all of the private keys I need for the application. In the mean time, my source code is stored in a private Github repository, only accessible via two-factor or private key authentication. Granted, I'm still putting quite a bit of faith in Github here, but the stakes aren't all that high for this particular case.</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p class="text-center">Staying true to my well-documented inability to write timely posts, here's a post that I probably should have finished three months ago.</p>
<p>I wasn't always the truck-faring degenerate that I am now. Reading some of my earlier posts, I can vividly remember a (roughly four percent) younger, more hesitant Brandon, sitting in an airport terminal, running through the plan over and over in his head, making sure he didn't miss any important details. I'd picked out a class of vehicle, I'd picked out a place to get my private mailbox through, I'd scoped out parking locations. It was all there, I just had to go out and do it. I had some ideas about what truck-life would be like, but no experience to say whether or not my trepidation was justified.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe, at least for me, but I recently celebrated my one-year truckiversary. One whole year. Inside the box. Just a man and his moving truck. And somehow (even in spite of my <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/strange-times-in-truck-town/5756035713204224">last post</a>), I managed to survive it without being arrested, abducted, robbed, murdered, or otherwise maimed in some bizarre truck-related incident. Not to say that the intervening year has been a quiet one. On the contrary, it's been pretty eventful. Between <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5639274879778816">surviving my first night</a>, a host of <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Home+Improvement">Home Improvement</a> projects, planning the <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5669283816275968">future</a>, my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5647308616105984">eventual eviction</a>, and all the <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Thoughts">pseudo-philosophizing</a> along the way, I've been busy.</p>
<p>To celebrate the milestone, I thought it'd be interesting to go back to one of my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5741031244955648">first posts</a> where I weighed out the pros and cons of adopting my truckly ways, and see how right (or wrong) I was. For your convenience, my dearest reader, I'll quote each pro/con from the original post here.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money Savings.</strong> Even sharing bedrooms, rent in the Bay area is going to cost at least $1,000 a month. That's a bare minimum, it doesn't include utilities or anything else. It's $12,000+ a year that I'm practically just burning. No return, no equity, just gone.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This one definitely held up. Whether it was <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5690820929781760">paying off my student loans</a> or <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5671321778257920">utilizing tax-advantaged accounts</a>, the truck definitely gave me some financial flexibility. What I didn't realize at the time was the different ways those savings would compound. Not only do I get to invest all of that redirected rent money, but I get to invest all the money I'm not spending on furniture, and utilities, and buying food just so my refrigerator doesn't get lonely. Sure, now I spend money on <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Home+Improvement">weird truck-improvement projects</a>, but those are comparatively cheap and I usually end up learning something too.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Life Experience.</strong> I've never truly stepped outside my comfort zone. After living in California for a summer, I realized just how little of the world I've actually seen. If I do plan on travelling the world, I'll need to be comfortable with unconventional living situations, and this is certainly a good place to start. Plus, there is never going to be a better time in my life for me to try this. I'm young, flexible, and I don't have to worry about this decision affecting anyone else in my life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This one was also spot on. Up until last year, I felt like my life had been pretty tame. I felt like I was following the prescribed course, the one laid out in front of me. You know the one: work hard in high school to get into a good college. Work hard in college to get a good job. Work hard at your job so you can fill your suburban home with stuff you don't need to impress people who don't care. Retire, <em>then</em> figure out what you want to do. I know, <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/the-quest-for-arbitrary-milestones-/5767494685949952">I've said all this before</a>. It's true though. And it's also true, I was passively barreling down that exact path, right up to the "fill your suburban home with stuff" part. That's where it kinda lost its appeal for me.</p>
<p>I'm glad to say that the truck has definitely broadened my horizons. I can think of a handful of times where my justification for doing something crazy was, "Hell, I already live in a truck, why not?" Now that my comfort zone can be summed up as "anything that won't definitely kill me", I'm much more open to experiencing everything the world has to offer.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transportation and Proximity.</strong> Having a car is very much a necessity, and by living in it on campus, I can cut my commute down to a few seconds instead of hours, which means I can spend my time more productively. Plus, I hate traffic, and my company's 25,000+ employees ensure that there is a whole lot of it in the morning and evening hours.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This actually isn't as big of a deal as a I thought it would be. Since I wake up so early, I wouldn't really deal with traffic even if I was living in an apartment a town or two away. That said, I'd like to think I'm saving resources by not having heating/cooling/electricity and minimizing my driving. I'm no Captain Planet, but it doesn't hurt to do your part.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health Benefits.</strong> If I'm living in a van, I have no choice but to go to the gym on campus to shower, so living in a van provides me with a strict daily regimen. In a similar vein, since I'm eating all my meals at work, it means my diet will be organized into three meals a day during the week, without any late-night snacking.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This feels about right, though I <em>might</em> have been a little overly optimistic. I usually exercise 6-7 days a week, but my "strict daily regimen" isn't quite the army drill I made it out to be. I definitely snack a bit at work. I go out to the bar with my friends on occasion, and usually end up dragging myself to the gym an hour behind schedule the next day.</p>
<p>I guess there is a small sorta health-related downside I didn't consider though. I don't get sick very often, but when I do, it's tempting to blame the truck. If I have a sore throat, I'll catch myself thinking "maybe there isn't enough ventilation in the truck", or if I have a runny nose it's something like "maybe the truck is too dusty". I have no way to prove whether or not these things are true, but the fact of the matter is I still get sick less frequently than I did when I lived in an apartment, so even if the truck is occasionally striking down my immune system, it's not often enough to be an issue.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Suicide.</strong> I will most certainly be "That Guy". No amount of planning or forethought excuses the fact that I'm the psychopath living in a van in the parking lot. People will eventually find out, and it <strong>will</strong> affect my social life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This one goes both ways. I was right, people <strong>definitely</strong> found out. But I was also wrong, too, because I thought it would affect my social life for the worse. Instead, I've been <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5663741160980480">meeting up with like-minded mobile home enthusiasts</a> and I'm more likely to take <a hrefe="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5732694713434112">impromptu trips</a> with friends. Speaking of friends though, mine have no problem filling lulls in conversation by talking about how I'm "the truck guy". And the response I get, without fail, is always, "Oh you're <strong><em>that</em> guy</strong>?!"</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inconvenience.</strong> Living in a car is not convenient. There's no bathroom, shower, or refrigerator in a reasonable distance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This one ended up being a bit overblown. I don't know if I have superhuman bladder muscles or what, but I've never found myself running to a bathroom at two in the morning or anything ridiculous like that. And as a consequence of my routine, I don't end up missing the lack of shower either, gyms have more than handled that one for me. As for refrigerators, the only reason I could possibly want one is to bring home leftovers after going out for dinner, but I'm a human garbage disposal and my plate is always licked spotless by the end of a meal, so that's a moot point.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stress and Anxiety.</strong> The whole process is supremely stressful. Picking out a van, buying it, converting my license, getting insurance, all without a car and all before I've even started working and making money is a lot to deal with. Not to mention the illegality of most of it. Then once all of those things are out of the way, I'm still pretty anxious about being caught, and how I'm going to sneak into and out of my van.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial process was stressful, and reading this over I can feel my blood pressure rising at the thought of those early days. I don't worry about being caught anymore. For one, I found out that it is actually legal to sleep in your car where I live, as long as the car is legally parked. For two, I've been doing it so long that it doesn't really phase me anymore, which I talked about a bit in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5659645909663744">this post</a>. Hell, just last weekend I hopped out of the back of the truck in the middle of the night because there were a bunch of kids sitting on my tailgate. They were talking about tagging up the side of my home and I wanted to let them know that I'm the only one who does any truck decorating. The look on their faces was totally priceless.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upfront Expenses.</strong> At least with renting an apartment, I'd be paying gradually, without too much upfront cost. But between buying the car, buying insurance, fixing the car, setting it up, and the taxes and fees on top of all those things, it's a pretty big financial burden for someone who hasn't even started working yet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's true, the cost of the truck would have cut my student loans in half if I had spent the money on that instead. However, it's more likely I'd have been using at least a few thousand dollars to pay for a security deposit and a few months rent when trying to land an apartment. At the time, it seemed like I was signing my life away for this box truck, but after a few paychecks it didn't matter anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good luck getting laid.</strong> Interestingly enough, it was my mom who asked me about this one. I can only imagine that it's going to be next to impossible to get laid when I'm the van guy. Sure, I can get a hotel for the night, but it's still strange and I still have a bit of explaining and convincing to do. Since I'm not nearly smooth enough for that, I've accepted the fact that I'm going to be celibate for the next who knows how long.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>People have always been <sup>uncomfortably</sup> curious about this one, so I'm sure my continued silence will be disappointing to some. But as it is, my life is not an episode of <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>. And I can pretty confidently say that I don't want it to become one, either.</p>
<p>I've said before (and will say again now): I'm consistently surprised at how receptive people are to the lifestyle I've chosen. At the very least, very few people treat me like the trailer park-reject I thought I was going to be seen as. Because of how expensive it is to live out here, my housing situation comes up more often than not in casual conversation, even without any coaxing from me. It normally leads to some genuinely interesting conversations around goals and priorities.</p>
<h2>Summing it up</h2>
<p>Overall, I like to think the truck has changed me for the better. I'm certainly more cognizant of my tendencies to <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5754903989321728">judge</a>, of my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5768755258851328">work-life balance</a>, and of what <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5701867585667072">simplicity</a> means to me. And looking back over my list, it's good to see I was more wrong about the "Cons" than anything else. I've spent a lot of time thinking about what I would change if I did it all again, and I usually don't come up with much. In fact, if I could go back in time and give my younger self advice, right when his plane had just landed in California, I'd really only have one thing to say: <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/post/parking-perils/5693417237512192">try a smaller truck</a>.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Before I say anything else, let me be clear: this isn't me making up some spooky story, this actually happened to me this morning, Monday August 1st, at 6 am.</p>
<p>I had a series of strange dreams about spies and nuclear war last night. Pretty dramatic, but I have weird dreams all the time. The problem is that things got weirder <em>after</em> I woke up.  First, I noticed a bitter taste in my mouth that I have no explanation for. I ate nothing strange last night and washed up using the same products I've been using for as long as I care to remember. That's not a big deal though. What is a big deal is this:</p>

<p>In case it's hard to tell, that's a muddied footprint <strong>on my sunroof</strong>, which <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5694639155707904">I had installed a few months ago</a>. Half-awake, I wanted to think it was literally anything else. Maybe a bird had dropped a fish or something and it had left that mark. Maybe it was just the imprint of a weird leaf. Highly unlikely (bordering on nonsensical), but I really desperately wanted to believe it wasn't a footprint. Unfortunately, I walked outside and proceeded to find this:</p>

<p>I took pictures like I was cataloging a damned crime scene, because I practically was.</p>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, that confirms my fears pretty concretely. Someone left a trail of hand and footprints as they climbed their way onto the roof of the truck while I was sleeping last night. It's also pretty obvious that I desperately need to wash the truck, but I'm glad I didn't in this one specific instance, because if the truck was clean, the footprints wouldn't have been so visible.</p>
<h2>Searching For Answers</h2>
<p>I don't remember much out of the ordinary from last night. Sounds from cars leaving a nearby concert, maybe some kids hanging around and talking. The strangest thing I heard was a cop talking to someone and asking what they were doing. I don't know if the person was in a car or not, but the cop asked them for their license. They were slow to respond and seemed confused. I don't remember much else because I was half asleep, but I've never heard of cops hanging around this area, so it's pretty curious that they were there in the first place. While I was taking the above pictures, I noticed a man standing next to his car maybe 50 feet away. I asked him if he saw anything, but he didn't speak much English. I showed him the footprints on the truck and motioned to my feet to try to convey what had happened. He showed me the bottom of his shoes (which had a totally different pattern than the marks on the truck) and said he didn't know anything. Oh, and I checked all of my own shoes to see if the pattern matched, in case I had been sleep-walking or something (couldn't rule anything out). As expected, no match there either.</p>
<p>And that's all I have, leaving me with far more questions than answers. First and foremost:</p>
<p><em>How the hell did I not wake up?</em> I didn't have ear plugs in and I'm a pretty light sleeper. Usually a person talking or a gust of wind is enough to stir me into something nearing consciousness. The movement of someone jumping onto the truck and walking directly above me should have woken me up, and the truck must have groaned and creaked <strong>loudly</strong> when they got onto the roof, which isn't meant to support anything nearing the weight of a person.</p>
<p><em>Why did they leave a footprint on the sunroof too?</em> They couldn't have possibly stood on it, it's slippery, slanted, and has small plastic pieces that would have broken trying to support their weight. That means (barring any better explanations that escape me) they pressed their foot against the sunroof just to leave the print. If I hadn't seen that one, it's unlikely I'd have found the other footprints on the hood and cab.</p>
<p><em>And what were they even doing up there? Were they watching me sleep? Were they looking for something?</em> I don't even know what they would have seen looking down into the truck. I was sleeping directly under the sunroof and I get the heebie-jeebies thinking about waking up in the middle of the night to see someone looking down at me. I'm not even sure if they'd be able to see me, there's no light in the truck and very little coming in from outside, most of which they'd be blocking with their body, plus the sunroof has a pretty heavy tint on it. Unless they had a flashlight, I don't know if they'd have seen much. I couldn't get any pictures of the roof, because I was unwilling to climb up there myself, but I did pull myself up so I could peek onto the roof. I didn't see any footprints towards the back, so they didn't walk around once they were up there. Maybe it was just some bored kid with a short attention span trying to get a better vantage point. Maybe they were looking for something to steal, and were trying to "case" the truck. If they were, I have bad news for them: I don't really have anything of value in there. In fact, if I came back to the truck to find every single thing missing, it'd hardly change my plans for the day.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm in the world's worst rendition of Cinderella, where the glass slipper has been replaced with a muddy sneaker print, and my Cinderella is a creepy dude who watches people in the middle of the night.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Student loan debt is, uh&#8230;<em>a problem</em> in the good ole US <span class="small"><sup>of</sup></span> A, to say the least. It has passed credit cards for the number two spot on the list of "biggest things holding American wallets hostage," behind only mortgages at this point. When millennials wake up in a cold sweat in the dead of night, filled with a deep, overwhelming, and existential sense of dread, it's probably because student loans are haunting their dreams. Okay, hopefully it's not <em>that bad</em>, but it's no wonder student loans get a bad rap,  with millions of The Indebted&#8482; buckling in for the long haul, getting ready to work and whittle at the loans for the next decade (or more).*</p>
<p>Looking back through my posts, it's clear I've been pretty active in trying to take my own personal student loan blackhole down a notch (or twenty thousand). Hell, it was one of my inspirations for trying to live more simply; I figured that the sooner I got this cap-and-gown-wearing monkey off my back, the sooner I'd have the financial flexibility to branch out and explore.</p>
<div class="inline-image">

<p>Personally, I think a cap-and-gown-wearing monkey is a great metaphor for student loan debt. It's also just adorable.</p>
<p>Indefinitely borrowed from <a href="http://idieh74.blogspot.com/">this blog.</a></p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>I'm happy to say that, as of June 7<sup>th</sup>, I've officially paid my student loans in full. What follows is my account of everything that made it possible.</p>
<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>I didn't grow up particularly wealthy. I didn't grow up particularly poor either. "Decidedly Middle Class" is what I'd call it, if you asked me. I'm fortunate enough to have two parents who love me dearly, even if they gave up on each other a long time ago. I never had a college fund, just some Bar Mitzvah money that disappeared with my parents' marriage and my childhood home. Never figured out what happened to the money, but I got this really great shirt when my Dad came back from Las Vegas.**</p>
<p>Anyway, when it came time to apply to colleges, my guidance councilors basically told me the sky was the limit. Accepting their advice with a little too much fresh-faced optimism, I applied to Caltech, Carnegie Mellon, Frank W. Olin, Harvey Mudd, MIT, Stanford, and Yale, in <del>no</del> particular order. Oh, and I applied to UMass Amherst too, almost as an afterthought. They didn't require an extra essay and they waived the application fee, so I figured why not?</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="text-center"><strong>I got denied from every single school</strong></p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="text-center small">...except for UMass.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I wasn't <em>outright</em> denied from all those schools. Some of them waitlisted me first, and then promptly denied me once a more-qualified applicant accepted. I'd argue that this was actually worse. In retrospect, I was definitely a bit too idealistic. Sure, I had good grades, but I wasn't exactly a seven-sport athlete who had cured cancer by the age of four, which feels like the bare minimum these days in the increasingly ridiculous rat race of college admissions. It probably didn't help that my high school is ranked 226<sup>th</sup> in the state of Massachusetts (at least according to <a href="https://k12.niche.com/hull-high-school-hull-ma/rankings/">some random website I found</a>). Anyway, the whole experience was wholly ego-crippling for 18-year old Brandon, who didn't realize the blessing in disguise that had been handed to him.</p>
<p>Here's the quite literal deal: UMass Amherst is a state school, and a good state school at that. It's also a Massachusetts state school. And 18-year old Brandon was a Massachusetts resident. This means he could go to school there for <a href="http://www.umass.edu/umfa/undergraduates/costs">over $16,000 <strong>less</strong> each year</a> than his out-of-state counterparts. This is a nice discount on a school that was already only half the price of the next priciest school he applied to. Further, Brandon's state test scores from like, middle school, qualified him for a <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/adams.html">state scholarship</a> <strong>that covered all tuition for four years</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Wait what, free tuition for your whole college career? That sounds way too good to be true. Also, stop talking in third-person.</em></p>
<p>It's totally way too good to be true. Tuition <em>is</em> free, but state schools redefine tuition to be a small chunk of the cost of attendance. Still, an $857 discount per semester is icing on the already heavily-discounted cake. And so we're off to a good start.</p>
<h3>Onwards, to College</h3>
<p>My <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">FAFSA</a> made it clear I'd still be paying a few grand out of pocket each semester (because I was Decidedly Middle Class&#8482; and all). So I applied for the highest-paying job on campus I could find: driving buses. I got the job and started training a few weeks into my college career. I set up a payment plan with the school every semester. I checked the loans I was taking every year and declined them when I thought I could pay the difference, especially when they were unsubsidized. I applied for every scholarship that seemed vaguely relevant. I eventually started developing software systems for the bus company and learned how to build pretty legit web apps. I took that knowledge and used it to do some independent contract-work. I graded Computer Science classes on the side. I paid down the compounding student loan interest whenever I had some extra money.</p>

<p>Driving a bus for perhaps the last time, to my own graduation. As is tradition.</p>
</div>
<h2>Paying It Back</h2>
<p>The party is over. It's June 2015 and I've graduated college. I shook some hands, hopped off the stage, threw my cap-and-gown aside, and hopped on a plane. At this point, I've already purchased and moved into The Box and settled into a nice routine. It's time to face the facts and figure out my finances. My loans have a six-month grace period before I have to start paying them, but since they've been compounding interest the entire time (including some of the subsidized ones as I found out, much to my chagrin), I figure I'll get started right away. Step one is figuring out how much I owe, and who I owe it to. You'd think this would be the simple part, but with all the emails and exit interviews and papers to sign and forms to fill out, it's easy to lose track. I didn't have any private/third-party loans, but I can only imagine it being that much more confusing.</p>

</div>
<p>After all was said and done, I graduated college with $21,927.50 of debt. A large chunk of change to be sure, but that's not even half a year's tuition at a lot of brand-name schools, so I consider myself fortunate in that regard. I had already paid an additional $27,915.50 out of pocket during my four years, and another $772.29 went to interest. In total, my college education cost me $50,615.29.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yeadnrGBA78jOGH6OgADVp-sA_iiuk0aiRbqxFxj6Z0-bTqNQ904md2Ww5IGqlB9fwelfhHnZLSqitEV3auzZ7Pg55n35NRuGlc=s800"/>
<p>My loan balances with respect to time. The large dips generally correspond to stock grants and bonuses.</p>
</div>
<p>Once I started working, paying the loans down became a game. Since my monthly expenses were (and still are, for that matter) virtually nil, what wasn't going into <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5671321778257920">tax-advantaged accounts</a> was split between my investment portfolio (75% <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0970">VTI</a>, 25% <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=3369&amp;FundIntExt=INT">VXUS</a>) and loans, in a ratio that changed depending on my mood and desire to see the debt graph (pictured above) head south. I funneled bonuses and stock grants to the cause, which correspond to the larger dips on the chart.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>I'm incredibly fortunate in that I was able to pay off my debts in a relatively short period of time. Ironically, the largest factor that enabled me to do so was basically out of my control. At 18 years old, I would have chosen any other college on my list, had any of them accepted me. Given that they'd all have been <strong>at least</strong> twice the price, it follows that it'd have taken me twice as long (or longer). Worse still, I can't see how it would have been any better for me in the long run. It's easy for me to say this now, but I believe that you'll get out of school whatever you're willing to put into it, regardless of the brand name (and accompanying price tag).</p>
<p>After that initial decision of where to go, it really just comes down to looking your debt in the face and knowing everything about it. Who are the loans with? What interest rates do they have? Do they accumulate interest while you're in school? When do their grace periods end? How much will the monthly payment be? Which payment plan options do they offer? How much can you afford to pay? Are there any debt forgiveness programs for your profession? The more you know about the enemy, the more manageable they are.</p>
<p>As a parting note, though this post isn't all that timely given that I paid off my loans almost two months ago, it <em>is</em> timely because my more-symbolic-than-actually-to-be-taken-seriously savings clock has nearly reached the total volume of student debt I started with. So my (very approximate) rent savings alone nearly paid for my education. There's probably some more meaningful, deeply symbolic message to be extracted from that, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>**<em class="small">I'm not bitter though. If I had had a college fund and hadn't had to work through college, I wouldn't have landed the jobs that gave me the experience that prepared me for my current (dream) job. There's always an upside.</em></p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>It's been a while since I last <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5724160613416960">lambasted</a> any of the ideals that keep the American Economic Engine&#8482; chuggin' along. I'm talkin' about things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exceptionalism">"Exceptionalism"</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconsumption">"Overconsumption"</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism">"Materialism"</a>, and any other <em>&#8209;isms</em> and <em>&#8209;umptions</em> you want to throw into the mix. Given my relative reticence on the topic, I thought it was high time I took some pot shots at Uncle Sam. Subsequently, I've spent a long time staring at this blank expanse of screen, musing over what edgy and Forced Witticisms&#8482; I can put here. Strangely enough, nothing I put down feels particularly pleasing, probably because I don't think I have anything <em>useful</em> to say on the matter.</p>
<p>Making fun of how we do things in America just feels like low hanging fruit, or more fittingly, a cakewalk. It's a lumbering, slow moving target, weighed down by one too many Big Macs.* Plus, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1BQPV-iCkU">Wall-E already did it</a> way better than I could anyway. So instead, I'm hoping it'll be slightly more productive to shift the focus and talk about how I personally make my purchasing decisions. Summing it all up in a flow chart that came out more complicated and less aesthetically-pleasing than I was hoping for:</p>
<h2 class="text-center">Should I Buy that ShinyNewThing&#8482;?</h2>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/39qekwd2u8thN99k-hPIHH6W5GNaEKkbthtZrNLTGwXoD4z__2iEMtuRogFneghGadakkd_QSFmUYUCebsa3SMSbfxPDs9HCOI1y=s1000"/>
<p>If the chart is too small, you can find a bigger version <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/39qekwd2u8thN99k-hPIHH6W5GNaEKkbthtZrNLTGwXoD4z__2iEMtuRogFneghGadakkd_QSFmUYUCebsa3SMSbfxPDs9HCOI1y=s1000">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Before we get started, let me just say that this grossly idealistic decision-making process only really applies to buying <em>stuff</em>: physical objects that I plan on keeping around. It doesn't make sense for the necessities like food or toiletries, or experiences like trips and concerts. I'll <sup>maybe</sup> touch on that at the end.</p>
<h2>Step 1 - Recognize the Reality</h2>
<p>The starting point of my flow chart is:</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Will you literally die if you don't make this purchase?</strong></p>
<p>And the answer is <strong>No</strong>.<p>
<p>I put this at the tippity-top because it's important to go into a potential purchase with a properly prepped and calibrated cash compass. The fact of the matter?  Life will go on even if you don't buy yourself that ShinyNewThing. If you're reading this, there's a healthy chance you live in a wealthy, developed nation and are not in any real risk of starving to death, or dying of a untreated illness. Whatever the object of your affections, however ravenously you find yourself drooling and hankering, your heart will not <em>actually</em> stop beating if you don't acquire it. The Earth will keep spinning. The sun will continue to turn hydrogen into heavier elements. And we'll all still be inhabiting <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/267875-look-again-at-that-dot-that-s-here-that-s-home-that-s">a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam</a>.</p>
<h2>Step 2 - Check your Inventory</h2>
<p>Okay, so you've got your heart set on acquiring ShinyNewThing. It glistens like a diamond and you get butterflies any time some of its calculatingly-crafted marketing material flutters past your eyes. It promises to be revolutionary, and improve your life in ways that you can't even begin to understand until you've got your hands wrapped around&#8230;whatever it is. But have you taken a good, hard look at what you've already got?</p>
<p>Personal Example: The <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/galaxy-s7-features-and-specs/">Samsung Galaxy S7</a> is out. Compared to my current phone, the S7 has a higher-resolution screen, better cameras, a bigger battery, a faster processor with more cores, twice as much RAM, improved water-resistance, and supports quick charging. Not only will I be able to Snapchat at the speed of light, but this phone will improve my libido and cure most forms of cancer too. And to think, I could buy one with a single week of rent-savings. It seems like a no-brainer, so why haven't I tossed my dusty, worn down, three-year old phone out the (hopefully proverbial) window?</p>
<p><strong>Because it still works.</strong></p>
<p>Not only does it work, but it isn't any less functional just because a newer, better phone came out. It's not like Samsung released the S7 and suddenly every other phone developed crushing feelings of inadequacy and stopped working. If something I own already does the job for me, why would I be in the market for another one? I'm no worse off just because something newer and shinier exists. If I wasn't struggling to make do without it, why get it? Why be <del>complicit</del> an active agitator in a growing <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/12/product-design-and-recycling/">E-Waste</a> problem? Why not allocate that money to some other more productive or actually useful area of my life?</p>
<p><em>But Brandon, what if the thing I already have is broken?</em></p>
<p>Well in that case, you've just found a great opportunity to learn something new. Do a bit of research and see if it's something you can fix yourself. The Internet is a pretty incredible resource as far as DIY/fix-it projects are concerned. Smartphone took a tumble? There's a decent chance you can fix your <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Phone">phone</a> or <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2907078/how-to-replace-a-broken-laptop-screen.html">laptop</a> screen. Eyeing that new Keurig? See if you can <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Repair-Your-Clogged-Coffee-Maker/">unclog your old coffee maker</a>. A new jacket tickling your fancy? You can probably <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5975700/how-to-fix-every-common-zipper-problem">fix the zipper</a> on the one you just got. Personally, most of what I know about the innards of computers came from replacing dead hard drives and screens and upgrading RAM on my friends' old discarded computers and then using them for my own nefarious purposes. Why not breathe some new life into your possessions and gain a new skill while you're at it?</p>
<p><em>Brandon, you don't understand. The thing I already have is really, <strong>really</strong>, irreparably broken.</em></p>
<p>Perfect, now you have a chance to see if you can live without it. Sometimes you can't, and the answer will unequivocally be "No, I can't live without this because of my job/family/lifestyle/pet tarantula/whatever", and that's fine. But other times, maybe you'll realize that you're actually better off not replacing whatever broke. Maybe your life is simpler without it, or you have more free time because you're not so glued to it, or you just never really needed it in the first place.</p>
<p>A prime example from my life is a pocket projector I had for a few months, which I bought so my friends and I could watch movies in the truck (which we totally did). And that was all fine and dandy, but at the end of the day it was still just another device for me to charge and store and generally have to deal with. It didn't exactly break on me, so this isn't really the best example, but I ended up selling it and felt generally better off for having done it.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Just Think About It</h2>
<p>Too often we just jump into purchasing things without ever stopping to question what it means to us. We set our sights on some object of our desires, and buy it as soon as we can afford to. That's not hard-coded into our DNA though. It's not like we evolved the desire to buy stuff. We did, however, evolve mushy meat brains vulnerable to being manipulated in lucrative ways by carefully crafted marketing campaigns.** But if we take a step back and look at the decimals and dollars of it all, we can make a more informed decision about how important a purchase is to us.</p>
<p>Where does most of my money come from? Well, since I'm not (yet) retired, it comes from me spending a double-digit number of semi-waking hours each week doing assorted tasks for other people, being <em>just</em> proficient enough that they compensate me for it. I exchange my time for money via my job. Time goes in, money comes out. Simple. Since most of my money comes from my time-commitment to work, it makes sense (at least in my head) to view money as just a loose abstraction over my time, right? Everything I buy takes some non-zero amount of time for me to earn. Thinking about it this way, why would I want to throw my time away for things that aren't worth it? Why would I want to trade weeks or even months of my time for that ShinyNewThing? When will my rant/bombardment of rhetorical questions end?</p>
<p>To clarify: I enjoy my job. I genuinely do. That said, if money was taken out of the equation, it's unlikely I'd continue working the exact same number of hours I do now. If I had unlimited <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXJXLq1lN7U">dollar <sup>dollar</sup> bills <sup>y'all</sup></a>, I'd definitely make a few changes in my day to day life, but I'll save those for another post. If you have other plans for your days besides working, why not use the money to make that a reality? As <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">early retirement extraordinaire Mr. Money Mustache</a> will gladly tell you: if you spend a dollar, it's gone forever. But if you invest a dollar, it's now working 24/7 to make you more money, usually through dividends or capital appreciation. And since money is basically time, <em>you're creating more time for future you</em>, which translates to more freedom in your work/life balance. So, at least from my perspective, instead of pouring time into getting that new 52 inch, 4K, 240 Hz, super flat-screen buzzword magic TV, it makes more sense to take those extra dollars and put them to work for me.</p>
<p>The thing is, at the end of the day, a flat-screen TV does nothing to make me a happier person. Neither does having a nicer car, or a shiny, carbon fiber road bicycle. And if it isn't making me happier, healthier, or just plain <em>better</em> as a person, it's not worth wasting my time/money on. Life is horrifically short in the scheme of things, and I'd rather build for my future and invest in experiences. ShinyNewThings eventually become DustyBasementFixtures, but experiences become fond memories. I guess that's my philosophy on spending money: invest in memories, not accessories.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">In my opinion, one Big Mac is approximately one too many Big Macs.</em></p>
<p>**<em class="small">The color red makes people hungrier. Luxury items cost whole, round number prices; discount items end in "99". Checkout aisles are full of impulsive items. There are entire college degrees dedicated to figuring out how to make people feel a certain way. Etc, etc.</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p class="small">It's been a while since my last post, and a lot has happened since then. I've hit my one-year truckiversary, surpassed $15,000 in monopoly money savings, and paid off the remainder of my student loans. Expect posts for these things in the coming weeks. As for my absence: I've been dedicating the majority of my free time to building an app for a small nonprofit to help Syrian refugees apply for scholarships. I like to think it's a worthy enough cause to excuse my tardiness and general inability to produce new blog content. Oh, and my laptop unceremoniously died on me. With that out of the way, onwards to the (lean) meat of the post.</p>
<p>I don't know at what point in history we thought it would be cool to start picking up heavy objects <em>for fun</em>. I'd imagine it'd have been pretty recently, it's not like you could stroll into a <a href="https://www.chipotle.com/">Chipotle</a> 2,000 years ago after a sweaty, Beyonc&#233;-fueled workout* and replenish all those burnt calories with a double chicken and guac burrito bowl. We live in a brave new world.</p>
<p>Regardless of when lifting and exercise for the sake of exercise became a <em>thing</em>, we're fortunate enough to enjoy the privilege today. I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5178081291534336">frequently</a> <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5697070107197440">allude</a> <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5645478960037888">to</a> how I take part in the fun: via a modified version of Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 program. That seems like a good starting point for this post, so let's do that.

<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>The 5/3/1 is a pretty standard strength-training routine, recommended to me by my good friend (and source of inspiration) Pat K., who wasn't too far off from setting a state record at a recent powerlifting tournament. I'll be channeling his knowledge and advice for pretty much the entirety of this post.</p>
<p>Anyway, the most important thing to know about the 5/3/1 is the concept of a training max (henceforth referred to as TM), which is a baseline amount of weight you'll use for each exercise. To calculate your TM for an exercise, take 90% of your one-rep max. If you don't know what your one-rep max is, use the formula:</p><p class="text-center"><strong>weight &#215; (1 + reps / 30)</strong>.</p>
<p>As an example, if I bench-pressed 195 pounds for 7 repetitions, my estimated one-rep max would be:</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>195 &#215; (1 + 7/30) = 240.5 pounds</strong></p>
<p>and my TM would be:</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>240.5 &#215; 90% &#8776; 215 pounds</strong></p>
<p>To start a 5/3/1 routine, you calculate your TM for overhead press, parallel squat, bench press, and deadlift, and then the workout is as follows:</p>
<p>
<div class="table-responsive">
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Week 1</td>
<td>Week 2</td>
<td>Week 3</td>
<td>Week 4</td>

<tr>

</table>
</div>
</p>
<p>A plus sign (+) after a number means "at least this many reps, but ideally you should continue the set until you reach fatigue". In turn, "fatigue" means "the point where your body has failed you and you're a sopping pile of ATP-depleted, lactic acid-filled muscle tissue on the gym floor." Week 4 is called a <strong>deload</strong> week, and is for recovery, basically a vacation for your muscles. I skip this most cycles, I've only actually ever felt the need to deload once or twice after particularly heavy weeks.</p>
<p>The <strong>Warm up</strong>s mentioned above are three sets you should do before each day's routine. Those sets are 40% x 5, 50% x 5, and 60% x 3 respectively, and help your muscles get ready for handling the heavier weight you're about to subject them to. <strong>They're super important unless you enjoy being irreparably injured.</strong></p>
<h2>The Routine</h2>
<p>The table above constitutes the core lifts of the 5/3/1 workout. The other main component of a 5/3/1 is the assistance work, which consists of all the supplementary exercises you do after you've done the core work, to add more exercise volume and build complementary muscles. My whole routine (leaving off the warm-up sets for brevity) looks something like:</p>
<h3>Monday - Military Press</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Military Press - Standard 5/3/1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rear Delt Raise</strong> 15 lbs &#215; Failure</li>
<li><strong>Cable Upright Row</strong> 30 lbs &#215; Failure<br/>Pat's suggestion was dumbbell upright rows with 25 lb weights, but my wrists don't appreciate that.</li>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 60% &#215; 8 &#215; 5 sets</li>
<li><strong>Pullups</strong> Body Weight &#215; 8 &#215; 5 sets<br/>I do body weight pullups because I don't have a weight vest/belt available to me. Try to keep a constant rest time between sets, and go until failure on the final set.</li>
<li><strong>DB Row</strong> 6 to 12 reps &#215; 5 sets<br/>Start with an amount of weight where failure occurs in  6 to 12 reps, and decrease weight with each set, trying to keep yourself in the 6 to 12 rep range. I start with 75 pounds and work my way down in 5 pound intervals from there.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tuesday - Parallel Squat</h3>
<p>Start each squat day with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cardio</strong> 10 minutes<br/>If you're like me and legitimately useless at jogging, this usually means 10 minutes of walking. Take longer strides, to start loosening up your legs.</li>
<li><strong>Foam Roll</strong> Legs and lower back<br/>If you've never foam rolled before, it's really relaxing. It's also a great way to limber up before/recover after a workout.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Stretches</strong> <br/>Pat recommends <a href="https://www.t-nation.com/training/defranco-agile-8">DeFranco's Agile 8</a></li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 45 lbs &#215; 8 reps<br/>A standard Olympic barbell weighs ~45 lbs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Week 1</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 65% &#215; 5</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 75% &#215; 5</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 85% &#215; 5  &#215; 5 sets<br/>Go to failure on the last set</li>
</ul>
<h4>Week 2</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 70% &#215; 3</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 90% &#215; 3</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 95% &#215; 3</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 100% &#215; 3</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 105% &#215; 3<br/>Keep adding 5% until you can't do three full reps</li>
</ul>
<h4>Week 3</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 75% &#215; 5</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 85% &#215; 3</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 95% &#215; Failure</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 85% &#215; Failure</li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 75% &#215; Failure</li>
</ul>
<p>End each squat day with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glute Ham Raises</strong> Body Weight &#215; 8-12</li>
<li><strong>Core work and lower back extensions</strong><br/>I like to do oblique twists ("Wood Choppers"), bicycle kicks, and stability ball roll-ins, but feel free to pick your own proverbial poisons.</li>
<li><strong>More Foam Rolling</strong><br/>Still legs and lower back</li>
<li><strong>Static Stretches</strong><br/>I also like to use an inversion table at the end of my squat days, but I haven't seen those at other gyms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thursday - Bench Press</h3>
<h4>Week 1</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 65% &#215; 5</li>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 75% &#215; 5</li>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 85% &#215; 5+</li>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 75% &#215; Failure<br/>This is a dropset, meaning you don't take a rest between the 85% set and this one.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Week 2</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 70% &#215; 5</li>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 80% &#215; 5</li>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 90% &#215; 5+</li>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 80% &#215; Failure<br/>This is <strong>not</strong> a dropset, rest after the previous set.</li>
</ul>
<p>End bench days on Week 1 and Week 2 with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Press</strong> 60% &#215; 8 &#215; 4 sets<br/>Try to minimize rests here, and time them so that you ideally reach failure on the final set.</li>
<li><strong>Rear Delt Raise</strong> 15 lbs &#215; Failure</li>
<li><strong>Weighted Dips</strong> Body Weight &#215; Failure</li>
<li><strong>Cable Upright Row</strong> 30 lbs &#215; Failure</li>
</ul>
<h4>Week 3</h4>
<p>Start and end your workout with the following warm ups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External Rotation</strong> 10 lbs &#215;  10 reps</li>
<li><strong>Internal Rotation</strong> 10 lbs &#215;  10 reps</li>
</ul>
<p>And the rest of the day's routine is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bench</strong> 160 lbs x 3 x 10 sets<br/>Keep the rests between 60-90 seconds. Add 5 lbs to the 160 lb base every cycle until you can't do the full 10 sets with 60-90 second rest times.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Friday - Deadlift</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadlift- Standard 5/3/1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Squat</strong> 50% &#215; 8 &#215; 5 sets</li>
<li><strong>DB Row</strong> Failure in 4-8 reps &#215; 2 sets</li>
<li><strong>DB Row</strong> Failure in 4-10 reps &#215; 2 sets</li>
<li><strong>DB Row</strong> Failure in 6-12 reps &#215; 2 sets<br/>Decrease weight with each set of rows.</li>
<li><strong>Pullups</strong> Body Weight &#215; Fatigue &#215; 4 sets<br/>Pat suggests switching up the grip for each set and trying narrow/wide/overhand/underhand pullups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Going Big</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of this vehicular voyage, I've always considered it a benefit how I'm forced to be consistent in my routine. But up until recently, I didn't really have anything tangible to show for it. I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5645478960037">mentioned</a> I was going for a combined lift (bench, squat, deadlift) of 850 pounds, and a few weeks ago, I decided I was ready to put the rubber to the proverbial road and go for it. So I took a week off from my normal routine and replaced each day with an attempt to see how much weight I could <sup>safely</sup> lift <sup>with proper form</sup>. For that week, I ate more, slept more, stretched more, and generally did things that would put me in tip-top lifting shape. In the end, I managed the following:</p>
<p>
Bench - 225 pounds<br/>
Squat - 295 pounds<br/>
Deadlift - 365 pounds
</p>
<p>...for a total of 885 pounds, pleasantly past my target. It's a shame though, because much like our base 10 number system makes <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5767494685949952">$10,000</a> appealing, it also makes 300 pounds appealing, which I was just shy of with my squat weight. Though at 5' 10" and 170 pounds, I'm happy with those numbers. Happy is different than content though, and naturally, my next goal is 900, then <sup>maybe eventually</sup> 1,000 pounds. The graph at the top is promising too, with its general upward trajectory (the fluctuations are likely because of the structure of the cycles, diet, and my sometimes non-optimal sleep schedule.)</p>
<h2>But Why?</h2>
<p><em>But Brandon, getting out of bed early in the morning and picking things up sounds awful, why would you do that to yourself?</em></p>
<p>Even if we ignore the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20837645">benefits of morning exercise</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SFD21Q">positive effects of exercise on the brain</a>, and the <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10578-008-0111-z">link between exercise and happiness</a>, there are still a couple of functional reasons. Firstly, there's just less going on at 5:30 in the morning, meaning that I'm way less likely to scare the ever-loving Hell out of some poor passerby when I throw open the back gate and crawl out of my tomb in the twilight. Even though I've <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5743114304094208">learned to not care</a> about people seeing me go about my truckly affairs, I'd prefer to not cause any heart-attacks.</p>
<p>Another big thing is that to me, progress is happiness. I plan on dedicating a whole post to it in the future, so in brief: I'm at my happiest when I'm improving at something, and with exercise it's easy to see and quantify that you're legitimately changing for the better.</p>
<p>The last reason I do it is simple: where else would I shower? I, like most people, prefer to go into work not looking like I just rolled out of the back of a truck. The gym has showers, and that's where I get my daily dose of post-workout de-truckification.</p>
<p><em>You could totally skip the workout and just use the shower though, duh.</em></p>
<p>I mean technically, yeah, but it just doesn't work like that on a personal level. I can't just traipse past a room full of equipment and motivated, fit human beings on my way to the showers. No, that right there is more than enough guilt and motivation (mostly guilt) to make that 2 hour pit stop in the weight room.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">Seriously though, Lemonade is a jam.</em></p>

<em>Source: <span>I'm sure stock photos seem normal in the parallel universe they're clearly photographed in. I'll let the watermarks explain where this gem came from.</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Looking at a list of unanswered questions people have sent me, I couldn't find a single reasonable thread that united any of them, save the fact that they all concern my truckly ways. They're all pretty much orthogonal in the N-dimensional space that truck questions occupy. Let's get to them.</p>
<p><em><strong>What does your family think of your living situation?</strong></em></p>
<p>I've <em>kinda</em> been doing my own thing since I was 15 or 16, and my family <em>sort of</em> accepts that I'll <em>probably</em> figure out something that works for me. That said, they naturally thought I was insane (and still likely do) when I told them about my truck idea, well over a year ago at this point. The more I explained it to them, the more I was able to convince them that I had some semblance of an idea what I was doing, for better or worse. So in short: they probably think I'm crazy, but they're impressed I haven't managed to burn the truck to the ground yet and/or get myself Very Arrested&#8482;.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are the worst and best parts of living in your truck?</strong></em></p>
<p>The best part is knowing that I'm <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5767494685949952">building the future</a> I want for myself. The worst part is probably not being able to cook. Not that I was good at cooking before, but I did definitely enjoy whipping up a meal for myself every once in a while. I hijacked a friend's kitchen (thanks Pragya!) to cook a Thanksgiving turkey, but I'm fairly confident that was the last time I attempted any comprehensive culinary conquest. Oh, and not being able to have any pets is also pretty sad, I'd most definitely have a canine companion if I was living in a more conventional location.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you do for ventilation?</strong></em></p>
<p>As a consequence of having a rear gate that locks from the outside, I've always had to keep the door open a crack to avoid being locked in. That's provided sufficient ventilation thus far, though I also <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5694639155707904">just had the sunroof installed</a> in the back of the truck, both to provide some ambient lighting and have a more appropriate ventilation solution. Ventilation wasn't really a problem before, but the closer the source of ventilation is to where you're actually breathing, the better.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why do you blur people's faces out in photos?</strong></em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5631943370604544">first time</a> was because I was (and still am) completely unaware of what the legal climate surrounding truck parties looks like, and I guess I'd also like to protect the privacy of my friends and family if at all possible. Plus, it lets me dust off my (extremely limited) Photoshop skills once in a while.</p>
<p><em><strong>How's El Nino working out?</strong></em></p>
<p>Initially, <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5678807906254848">pretty poorly</a>. Between the leak, and the impressively loud symphony of rain drops on a thin metal roof, the fairly frequent rain was less than friendly. But between <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5740423507083264">patching up the hole</a> and judiciously applying <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/3M-3-oz-Marine-Adhesive-Sealant-5203/100161471">marine sealant</a> to any location that looked like it might betray me at the first sign of water, the truck is in much better shape these days. I can relax and enjoy the occasional drizzle outside my office window without worrying I'm going to come home to a truck-cuzzi.</p>

<p><em><strong>If I wanted to live in a truck, would you guide me through it, like buying the truck, insurance, and all that legal stuff?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'd like to think I've covered most of that stuff on here, but definitely shoot me a question or email if you come up with anything I missed. I'm always happy to help people <del>convert to the dark side</del> get setup with a simpler, more efficient lifestyle.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have a plan for when you contract a debilitating case of viral gastroenteritis?</strong></em></p>
<p>I kinda do. My primary plan is to rely on my good health, nutrition, exercise, and sleep schedule to prevent debilitating cases of viral gastroenteritis in the first place. But if I were to find myself involuntarily returning the contents of my stomach with regular frequency, I'd probably take off work and grab a hotel room for a few days to  sleep it off. Luckily, I get sick pretty infrequently and haven't had to resort to the suite life just yet. Fingers crossed.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Truthfully, I've been doing a pretty awful job at keeping you guys updated with what I'm actually doing, truckwise. The last time I even <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5750085036015616">showed off the interior</a> in all its shanty glory was almost a year ago. In the intervening interval since my last Home Improvement update, I've completed a few fairly large truck projects. By "large", I don't mean anything that requires any real technical competence, but certainly larger than  <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5740423507083264">fixing the hole</a> or <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5730192894984192">doing arts and crafts</a>.</p>
<h2>Insulation</h2>
<p><em>Hold up, didn't you spend a whole post talking about how you <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5158086071287808">didn't need to insulate the truck</a>? What gives?</em></p>
<p>Okay okay, you caught me. I know I said it didn't make sense to insulate the truck, because it wouldn't be effective and I can just bundle up when I need to, but curiosity got the better of me after the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">idea was planted</a> in my head. You might remember that I fixed the hole in the truck after receiving wonderfully detailed instructions by a pseudonymous Nancy (still from <a href="http://www.pksafety.com/">PK Safety</a>). Well, as it turns out, Nancy also had some well-formulated ideas on how I could insulate the truck. After a modest amount of research, I decided, "What the hell, let's give it a go," and on nothing more than a whim, I started tearing apart the walls.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xUqB_3IQRj_TQO-2RQ45p75SUdz5Lfq1RbArilUjzlOFIMQ7a56SJEDQkxbcYd9OsSbwdxDlWy6Shddan7IvYSOiqZxTR7tmWbLk=s400"/>
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZmGyaeJcv4O3xMPEDWywvsHGgpCHVzqvXGY6slHv0VPTEldDrkBIFhxi-ST_1QEfpPbqQaGliOQ08uOLGTzvRjqNxJW0jAL7c2P-=s400"/>
<p>The wood slats I pulled off the walls, and some of the screws I had to coerce out to get the slats off.</p>
</div>
<p>The next step was to line the walls with insulation &#8212; Nancy suggested <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/R-Tech-3-4-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-R-2-89-Foam-Insulating-Sheathing-310873/202530470">3/4" rigid EPS foam sheathing</a>. From there, the process is measure, cut, foam seal around the edges, and tape into place. Given that I had to cut about seven 2' x 7' rectangles for each of the two sides, it should have taken a few hours if I was even remotely competent with this type of stuff. But no, instead of a casual few hours of finagling the new fixtures into place, installing insulation became a four month, on-again-off-again affair that kept my truck looking like a war zone for the duration.</p>
<p><em>How could this have possibly taken you four months?</em></p>
<p>Naturally, it wasn't four months of <em>constant</em> work, I was only working on it on weekends for the most part, and even then, some weekends I couldn't convince myself I wanted to work on it for more than half an hour or so. The biggest deterrent/problem I encountered was a lack of space. While I have way more than enough (arguably too much) space for simply living and existing, that ceases to be true when I'm trying to cut 4' by 8' sheets of insulation and move around my bed and dresser to access different parts of the wall. So I had to work in sections, e.g. move everything to the back right corner to work on the front left. It basically felt like a giant game of this:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ktISkwncdq_viVZm2RbNLJUjxO-MfHgEPqpA5_yO4nLJqRFtipWlsxnJXgVTxUCaGOGn3yPkkz93X_0bcbrjZqcUWLLbb73lTs1W=s400"/>
<p>I spent several months playing a life-size version of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiragames.unblockmefree&amp;hl=en">Unblock Me</a>.</p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EU6vJqWekt_7owOpmKjSsFuo9PuYzREC-EFNe-sYzKdIXifBQPdi9BCwz4EV8MI2Ue1CstHUbJ8KBDzsBGZ-0mdHHghtQnoAc8xIfA=s400"/>
<p>How much space an individual panel takes up when I lay it down to cut it. You'll notice there isn't a ton of room left to maneuver.</p>
</div>
<p>Another hysterical complication (which the borderline-prophetic Nancy had warned me about), is that every time you cut into these foam panels with a switchblade, you leave a trail of little styrofoam beads in its wake. So with each and every slice, all ~46 of them, the truck would essentially become a giant snow globe, and even the gentlest of breezes would spin a snowstorm into existence. Not wanting to litter the outside world with these onslaughts of artificial dandruff, I put a plank of wood across the entrance and swept the tiny nuisances away into a trash bag after every few cuts.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sg1VJNPr_EfUzoDUm-0olRyEy_kTEouBY7Sgpm27lh4TNnxLsjmRc03W1-VMMvbwET6wmwOA9rlIDKkzCSxJkz5B5rD2KgTZeJ0J=s400"/>
<p>What it felt like being in the truck for those four months. I was basically Homeless Snow White&#8482;*.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Final Result</h3>
<p>When all was said and done, it didn't look all that bad. I mean sure, it looks like I live in a hobo's spaceship with the shiny tinfoil coating, but at this point we're all painfully aware of how little I care about aesthetics.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x9WiHiv26mFFdZ1L3OFPj4d9bHfkem7RNJ7G7nzysD14INXJCEdHk_aqZran9iB2kqi2SdwX3x8I2fKSr5HKxMH4ZQ7Ral1zlkec=s400"/>
<p>I'm intentionally only showing you the right wall, because I did the left wall first and it looks <em>significantly</em> more shoddy. Also, notice the far more appropriate/less disastrous usage of "Great Stuff" expanding foam this time around.</p>
</div>
<p>I haven't actually noticed if the truck retains heat any better (or worse) since adding the insulation, it hasn't been cold (or hot) enough to tell. In any case, it was certainly a learning experience, and a great exercise in what I can do with the truck if I'm feeling particularly <del>bored</del> inspired.</p>
<h2>Skylight!</h2>
<p>Yeah yeah, I know it's <em>technically</em> called a "sunroof", but this is <em>my</em> home and I'll call it whatever I gosh-darn/damn-well please. Anyway, way back when I first got the truck, I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5750085036015616">mentioned</a> the possibility of getting a skylight. Cutting gaping holes in the truck is well-outside my truck-modification comfort zone though, so I opted to bring in the professionals over at <a href="http://www.happyvans.com/">Happy Vans</a>, who did the wonderful job pictured at the top. I've noticed far better air circulation/ventilation over the past few weeks, and it's nice waking up to a truck-full of sunshine on the weekends. The eventual goal is to cut a door between the cab and the back, so that I can actually lock the rear gate at night instead of keeping it cracked open and "locked" with vice grips. Happy Vans will probably be the ones doing that particular project as well.</p>

<p>The only modification I made was attaching some metal screen door mesh with a few neodymium magnets, to keep pests out.</p>

<em>Source: <span>An illustration from <a href="http://thefinancebuff.com/rollover-after-tax-to-roth.html">The Finance Buff</a> on how a Mega Backdoor Roth IRA works.</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>This post is less about the "trucks" and more about the "tax-advantaged accounts", which hopefully won't offend too many sensibilities. I just figured it's been a while since I last <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5669283816275968">forayed in my financials</a>, and the several ensuing months have seen some modifications to the plan. The biggest of these modifications is that I added a new tool to my early retirement arsenal: the <a href="http://thefinancebuff.com/rollover-after-tax-to-roth.html">Mega Backdoor Roth</a>.</p>
<p><b><em>The Mega Backdoor what?</em></b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/">Mega Backdoor Roth</a>. I'm no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant">CPA</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Financial_Planner">CFP</a>, or any other fancy three-letter money-managing acronym for that matter, so check <a href="http://whitecoatinvestor.com/the-mega-backdoor-roth-ira/">here</a> or the other two links above for a more thorough, accurate explanation. The gist of it is that the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Retirement-Topics-401k-and-Profit-Sharing-Plan-Contribution-Limits">IRS overall limit on contributions to retirement accounts</a> is $53,000, meaning you can contribute to more than just a 401k. I've mentioned in the past that I'm putting the maximum $18,000 into my 401k, and I'm being matched an additional $9,000 by my employer. That leaves $53,000 - ($18,000 + $9,000) = $26,000 to contribute to other tax-advantaged accounts. <a href="http://www.rothira.com/roth-ira-rules">Income limits</a> stop me from contributing directly to a Roth IRA, and even if I could, the max contribution via that regulatory avenue is $5,500. Thus, the process for getting that $26,000 into a Roth IRA is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>You add a paycheck deduction to contribute after-tax money to a 401k.* This doesn't actually sound all the useful, and on its own it really isn't. You're being taxed on the money before you put it in, and since it's a 401k, you'll be taxed on it when you take it out, so it functions like a non-tax-advantaged contribution at this point. The real magic happens in the next step.</li>
<li>Every time a paycheck contribution comes in, you <em>roll</em> the after-tax portion <em>over</em> into an out-of-plan Roth IRA.** At this point, you pay taxes on the capital gains you've earned on the contribution, which should be on the order of zero dollars and zero cents since it's only been sitting in there a day or two and the stock market isn't some magical money-printing machine, at least for a plebeian like me.</li>
<li>Wait for the rollover to go through and clear, then invest it in whatever funds tickle your fancy.</li>
</ol>
<p>The benefit of doing this is that, because it's a Roth IRA, you don't pay taxes when you take it out. The caveat is that, because this is a Roth IRA, you can't take the money out until you're 59.5 years old, barring a few exceptions like for buying a first home. You <em>can however</em> take out the principal whenever you want, if you find yourself in a pinch. This isn't something I was utilizing last year, partly because my paycheck would have been negative and partly because I had no idea how any of this worked. Luckily, I was clued in by a friend (thanks Mike!), and I've since received a bunch of comments/e-mails with similar tidbits of information. Unfortunately, the backdoor Roth isn't available in everyone's plan (your plan needs to support after-tax 401k contributions, among other things), and Vanguard didn't even support it except over the phone until last year.</p>
<h2>Deductions Redux</h2>
<p>Grab a glass of water, because this post is about to get <em>even drier</em>, as we dive into the wonderful and exciting world of paycheck deductions. I've made a few tweaks since last time, because now my contributions are spread out over the full year instead of the six months I worked last year. Doing some hardcore basic algebra:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>401k</strong> - In my infinite wisdom, I forgot to update my 401k contribution from the $1,200/paycheck I was doing last year, and continued to not realize it for a few pay cycles, so my contribution per paycheck is now ($18,000 - $1,200 * 2)/24 = <strong>$650</strong>/paycheck.</li>
<li><strong>HSA</strong> - My employer still puts $800 into my HSA each year and an additional $200 when I get my physical, so my contribution there is ($3,350 - ($800 + $200))/26 = <strong>$90.38</strong>/paycheck.</li>
<li><strong>Roth IRA</strong> - I didn't pull my act together and figure out the backdoor Roth stuff until after my first few paychecks of the year, so I'm currently contributing $26,000/24 = <strong>$1,083</strong>/paycheck.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all is said and done, my take-home pay is ~$2,000 a month. In the Bay Area, that would hardly cover rent and basic livings expenses&#8230;if I had them. It's a nice reminder that my lifestyle really is accelerating my ability to build the future I want, at no (or maybe even a negative) cost to my happiness. I truly am fortunate to be in the position I am.</p>
<h2>Balancing the Books</h2>
<p>Okay, so we've crunched the numbers and know how much money is going into these accounts, but what happens once it gets there? Well it's at the mercy of the stock market, of course. I'm no day-trader, so the daily/seemingly arbitrary fluctuations in stocks and funds don't have any real impact on me. I'm it it for the long haul, and I'd like to think that the intrinsic value of the companies represented by the funds I invest in <em>will</em> increase over the course of the next ten years. So for now, the change in my investments doesn't mean much to me. That said, I've been doing this eight months or so at this point, which has been enough time to see some small gains. My brokerage account, which I was putting more into before I started utilizing the backdoor Roth, currently has unrealized gains (because I haven't cashed out yet) of ~$350. The Roth IRA, which I've only been contributing to this year, has unrealized gains of ~$200. According to <a href="http://www.healthequity.com/">Health Equity</a>, my HSA investments have appreciated 4.2%, which is ~$200 of growth. In the same period of time, my student loans (which are paid ahead until 2019 and I've been more or less ignoring), have only accrued about ~$226 in interest, so the investments are indeed worth paying off the loans ever so slightly more slowly.</p>
<p>Aside from having to roll over the after-tax 401k money into the Roth IRA, my finances are pretty much on auto-pilot. All of the aforementioned accounts are set to reinvest the dividends as they come in, so those earnings will keep compounding as I put in more money and time goes on. This is nice because it means that I don't even have to think about investing or worry about too much money accumulating in my checking account and fighting in a losing battle with inflation (not that that's actually something to "worry" about anyway).</p>
<h2>Talking to an <em>actual</em> CFP</h2>
<p>One lovely feature of my employer's plan is that we can schedule appointments with a Vanguard Certified Financial Planner. This is great because my background in finance consists entirely of a handful of Google searches and I occasionally worry I have no idea what I'm doing. I'd consider this to be a problem because I'm throwing 90% of my money (and thus time) into what might as well be a black hole of legislation and taxation, with the expectation that my sacrificial offerings will magically generate financial independence ten years from now. So on Friday (aka yesterday) at 7:45 am, I spoke with a pleasant chap named Bob, who pored over my finances and listened to my early retirement goals. After some thoughtful consideration, he gave me a few pointers.</p>
<p>The gist of the conversation was that my current strategy (maxing out the 401k, HSA, and Roth IRA) is good, though as my total investment grows, he'd like to see more investments in small/medium cap businesses and some international funds. Once my stock grant vests (and subsequently sells) sometime next month, I'll be grabbing some combination of <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0569&amp;FundIntExt=INT">VTIAX</a>, <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0970&amp;FundIntExt=INT">VTI</a>, and <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0939">VO</a>. Bob also suggested converting some (10-20%) of my investments to <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=5100&amp;FundIntExt=INT">California Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt Fund Admiral Shares</a> as I near my early retirement date, which seems pretty reasonable to me. After a discussion about my travel plans, he voiced some concern about my ability to get/pay for health insurance while travelling internationally, though after a bit of research it appears I can actually use my HSA to fund that, which is a nice touch. Having some reassurance from a Professional Adult&#8482; that my future plans are feasible and not totally insane definitely upped my confidence regarding this whole ill-defined "growing up" thing.</p>

<p><em>But Brandon, what could you possibly have to clean or get rid of? You own like three things.</em></p>
<p>When I first started out, this was definitely true. The truck had fairly humble beginnings, it was legitimately just <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5750085036015616">a bed, a dresser, and a coat rack</a> dumped into the back of a moving van. But between <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Home%20Improvement">Home Improvement projects</a> and a few <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/tag/Biking">new</a> <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5711312218750976">hobbies</a>, I've actually accumulated a non-negligible amount of <em>stuff</em>. Looking around the truck, I'm currently the owner of about 5% of the products Home Depot sells, plus motorcycling gear to go along with my non-existent motorcycle, bicycling gear to go along with my actually-existent bicycle, about 72 ft<sup>2</sup> of insulation left over from a home improvement project I've been working on for 5 months, like 96 ft of lumber that I need to get rid of, and a whole assortment of other random doodads.</p>
<p>To my eyes, refreshed by a relaxing week of visiting friends in Tampa, all of this looked pretty ridiculous. I mean, it's always looked a little ridiculous, but it was looking <em>particularly</em> ridiculous today. Wasn't <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5724160613416960">one of the goals</a> of this whole thing to reduce the amount of random <em>stuff</em> I had? Didn't I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5732694713434112">value the simplicity</a> of not being inundated with <em>random objects</em>? Shouldn't living in such a small place have forced me to think more carefully about what <em>things</em> I owned? I tried to think back to when I bought each of the things I was now staring at, strewn across the truck floor and haphazardly tossed into heaps and bins.</p>
<p>The majority of the stuff could be traced back to some work I'd been doing on the truck: a drill here, a few rolls of paper towels there, some <del>duck</del> duct tape off to the side, an unopened box or two of sound-dampening foam. Going back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">slowly boiling frog</a> analogy I'm apparently pretty fond of, the slow creep of stuff into my life hadn't really set off any alarms, and I didn't notice until I'd already filled my living space up with it. Just to be clear, we aren't talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarders">Hoarders</a>-level clutter here, but definitely more than I was comfortable with. So I took a hard look at it all, and there were two major areas of improvement I came up with.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5704837555552256">this post</a>, I talked about how simply "defragmenting" could do wonders for the amount of available space you had. Too bad I wasn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#Deaths_in_Jonestown">drinking my own Kool Aid</a>, because a lot of my clutter problems could/can be remedied with a little bit of organization. Between hanging up my motorcycle and bicycle helmets, organizing my tool drawer, and cutting the (now dismantled) wooden railings down to a more reasonable size, there are a lot of small gains I can make here. Even just making things more or less accessible based on how often I use them could be a great exercise in streamlining my life. Really all I need is an uneventful Sunday morning, some nice weather, and a good playlist.</p>
<h2>Needs versus "Needs"</h2>
<p>Streamlining my life is a great first step, but if my goal truly is simplicity, I won't find it just by shoving extra things into the cracks and crevices of my life. I need to actually get down to the bare essentials. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that figuring out what I genuinely need is kinda hard. Like my tools for example, I definitely wouldn't have been able to rebuild my bike rack without a screwdriver or drill, but does that mean that I need them? Far more often than not, they're just taking up precious space in the back of my truck (and the back of my mind). So it looks like the tools will have to stay in this nebulous gray area of necessity for now. What I really need is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_library">tool library</a>, but it looks like the nearest one is nearly two hours away, in Berkeley.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I did find at least one area of my life ripe for simplifying: my wardrobe. Tell me if this sounds even remotely familiar: somewhere in your house/apartment/truck there is a swath of clothes that don't fit you right, or have fallen out of style, or were gifted to you, or you just don't like all that much for one reason or another, and they've taken up the executive role of "Dust Collector". Unpacking my bag from my Tampa trip, I noticed I wear more or less the same set of ~fifteen (collared/gym/t-) shirts and three pairs of pants every week, making this probably the lowest-hanging fruit in my latest crusade.</p>
<p>So, with no plans on my plate on a drizzly Sunday afternoon, I dug through the depths of my drawers, cleansed my coat rack, and took a quick trip down to <a href="http://www.goodwill.org/">Goodwill</a>. In typical fashion, I completely forgot to get a donation receipt, meaning I won't be reminded of my spring cleaning when doing this years tax returns in eleven or so months. Regardless, I still get to benefit from a slightly lighter life.</p>
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>More and more often, I've noticed that my posts end with some sort of faux-philosophical epiphany, where I wander upon some not quite revelatory insight about my own life and dress it up as meaningful exposition. I don't think that's happening this time around, for better or for worse. I don't have any sweeping proclamations about simplicity, necessity, and happiness, or how any of the three relate to each other.</p>
<p>Just kidding, I totally do.</p>
<p>In the end, balancing simplicity and necessity is a personal preference. Someone who has fewer needs can, almost by definition, live a simpler life. Whether that equates to happiness, well that's another personal preference and question all together. For me though? I'm a simple man, with simple pleasures. I don't enjoy being busy. I enjoy creating fulfilling work to do, but having too many things going on in my life only dilutes how much of myself I'm able to put into each one. So unless some divine inspiration strikes and tells me otherwise, I'll build my memories without accessories and find felicity in simplicity.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5764640680181760">Way back in July of last year</a>, someone gave me the idea to track how much money I was saving by not having to pay rent in the area. I crunched the numbers (in reality, like two numbers) and wrote the code, and the savings clock was born. When I flipped the switch, it showed a fairly disheartening <strong>negative</strong> $6,000 because I was still half in the hole from purchasing my Ford-fabricated flat. But in the intervening seven or eight months, I've had the pleasure of watching that number dwindle its way to zero (where I hit my break-even point), and as of this writing, work its way up to five digits in our (just as arbitrary as my formula) base 10 number system.</p>
<p><em>So Brandon, you've successfully saved $10,000, plus another $10,000 or so if you sold the truck. Has it been worth it?</em></p>
<p>This is <sup><sup>a paraphrased version of</sup></sup> a question I received recently, and it definitely made me think a bit. First off though, I'm not sure I agree with the phraseology, because this is basically the equivalent of saying: <em>Would you live in a truck for nine months for $20,000?</em> and I don't think that's the right approach. The short answer to both of those questions is unequivocally "Yes.", but I don't think that's really doing it justice. Phrasing it like that makes it sound like a dare, like it's something I'm enduring <em>just</em> for the money. It's not about being worth it or not, it's about finding a lifestyle that fits my needs. It's about figuring out where my priorities lie and what my goals are, and then picking a life that makes them achievable.  I've said before that being in the right <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5630721452408832">mindset</a> really is everything. And that applies more generally than just software engineers living in trucks too; going into any situation with an open mind and some goals will do wonders for your perception and overall happiness. I've written pages of posts expounding all the good things the truck lifestyle has done for me, but to put it into perspective, let's take a stroll through the hypothetical life of a much more vanilla Brandon, who chickened out of his crazy truck-centric life plans. We'll call him Normal Brandon&#8482;, or NB for short</p>
<h1>What would Normal Brandon's life look like?</h1>
<p>When NB first moves out to California, he spends two weeks living in his corporate housing, filling up his days with an endless search for long-term housing. After trawling around Craigslist, Zillow, and the "New Engineers" group his company set up, he eventually finds a roommate or two who are interested in living in South Bay, and together they find a place to inhabit. They all agree on the cheapest option they can find, which happens to be a second-floor apartment just outside of Mountain View. For ~$1,500 per person each and every month (plus utilities), they each get roughly 80 ft<sup>2</sup> of bedroom space. They also each get a complimentary half-hour commute in the consistently bumper-to-bumper traffic along the 101. In the event there is any amount of water falling from the sky, make that an hour-long commute. Not ideal, but certainly not the worst thing that's ever happened.</p>
<p>NB starts work and quickly settles into a routine. Since the corporate buses don't start running until around 7 am, he ditches the early morning exercise routine he adopted in college, and instead exercises after work, around 5 pm. As it turns out, this is peak gym time, and half of his workout consists of aggressive thumb-twiddling while waiting for a squat rack. To pass the time, NB <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5754903989321728">silently judges</a> everyone around him, criticizing form, or outfits, or any number of other silly things because NB is jaded and cranky over wasting so much time. He starts going to the gym less frequently to save himself the frustration. Back at his apartment, his roommates are thinking of getting some furniture to make the place less spartan-looking. NB agrees and chips in, and the trio pick up some Ikea couches and end tables, and a 46" flat screen TV.</p>
<p>NB spends most of his waking time during the week working. Normally he'll either go out Friday or Saturday, and then spend the other nights hanging out and watching a movie or two and playing some video games. Oh, and he sleeps in until like noon.</p>
<p>This goes on for a decade or so until NB's biological clock kicks in and he finds himself in a serious relationship, at which point he gets married, buys a house in the suburbs, produces <a href="https://www.census.gov/hhes/families/files/graphics/FM-3.pdf">1.9 children</a>, and spends the next 30 years working to pay off his mortgage and finance trips to Disney Land.</p>
<hr>
<p>You're probably thinking, "You know, NB's life doesn't actually sound all that bad." And I'd have to agree, it sounds like he has everything in order and is living some variation of the American Dream. He certainly doesn't sound <em>unhappy</em>.</p>
<p>He does sound boring though.</p>
<p>And that's what I'm most worried about. He sounds comfortable, he sounds complacent, and he sounds decidedly average. I'm worried he's going to wake up one day and realize he's 65 years old, wondering where the time went, all while he watched his perfectly <em>un</em>extraordinary life pass him by. I'm worried that he'll forget all of his goals and dreams and aspirations and he'll be content simply existing, a passionless lump of aging and dying cells smiling soullessly and nodding along to the tune of yet another water cooler conversation. And then he'll retire, ready to experience his new-found freedom just as his body begins to fail him.<sup><sup>I apologize for the grimness, I swear it'll lighten up now</sup></sup></p>
<p>So yes, I've saved $10,000+, but I've also reshaped the path I'm travelling on. Granted, this whole discussion suffers from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw man</a> fallacy, it's not like I can grab myself from an alternate timeline and see how he turned out. Nonetheless, the relative comfort and ease of the life I didn't choose leave a lot to be desired. For one, I wouldn't be as painfully aware of my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5768755258851328">work/life balance</a>. I enjoy what I do for work, and it's easy to get lost in it. If I didn't have to think long and hard about how to live so close to work without it becoming my life, it's likely I'd end up like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">slowly boiling frog</a>: working ever-longer days just because I didn't know what else to do, until eventually that's all I do or know or <em>am</em>. Without the threat of not showering and becoming a total bum looming over my shoulder, I wouldn't have nearly as much motivation to stay active and exercise, and I wouldn't be as consistent with it. And god forbid I had electricity and a living room, I'd end up buying a whole host of things that do nothing to make me a happier, healthier person.</p>
<p>But if it really came down to it, I could handle working longer, I could handle being less healthy, and I could handle owning things I don't need. What I would have trouble handling is the idea that I could lose my passion for life so easily. Getting into a routine is a double-edged sword. On one hand, everything goes much smoother when you've figured out a schedule that flows from one thing to the next. On the other hand, it's too easy to fall back to a routine just because it's what you're the most comfortable with, even if it isn't the best for you, or even what you want. And while I have all these websites and apps I want to build and posts I want to write and books I want to read and languages I want to learn and places I want to go, I could see all of those things just casually fading into the background noise of my perfectly acceptable normal life. The truck is a ridiculous, obnoxious reminder that I'm not ready to give up on any of that. And <strong>that</strong> is what makes it "worth it".</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><sub><em>Brief note: I wrote most of this on the plane, but it took me a few days to getting around to polishing it up.</em></sub></p>
<p>I've <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5728116278296576">thought travel</a>, I've <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5689792285114368">talked travel</a>, but aside from a few fleeting flirtations with decidedly domestic destinations, I hadn't really done much of it.</p>
<p>Until now, that is.</p>
<h1>By the Numbers</h1>
<p>I'm currently writing this at 35,000 ft, traveling at 556 mph on my way back from a business trip. By the time I touchdown in San Francisco, I'll have covered 13,587 miles in the sky and 34 hours and 31 minutes in airplanes and airports, meaning that this trip handily accounts for more travel than any two of my previous trips. Spanning four countries and as many languages, I had the chance to explore what might as well have been new worlds to me and dust off my paltry high school French knowledge in the process, which was actually <em>m&#234;me pire que je pensais</em>. My genuine apologies to anyone who was forced to struggle through a conversation with me and my rusty, awkwardly accented French.</p>
<h1>Making Memories: Montr&#233;al, Munich, and more</h1>
<p>Aside from the business portion of the trip, which proved to be wildly insightful and informative, I had some opportunities to really get a feel for what certain sections of the world have to offer. In short: new perspectives and a few centuries of lush, vivid history to explore. I ogled at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Port_of_Montreal">Old Port</a>, partook in poutine and attempted to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_City,_Montreal">the underground</a>. I meandered around Mont Royal, savored smoked meats, marveled at massive museums and cathedrals, and even won a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_lev">Leva</a> at a Bulgarian casino. I  chowed down on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currywurst">Currywurst</a> in Frankfurt and put back a beer in Bavaria. I &#8212; I could keep going, but I'm sure you get the idea at this point.</p>
<h1>Reaffirming the Future</h1>
<p>The trip also served to remind me of my plans for, well, the rest of my life. As a refresher, the current course I've been carving (hopefully) leads to <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5669283816275968">retiring young</a>, traveling the world, and working on technically challenging projects of my own design. But up until now, most of what I liked and knew about travel was learned secondhand, vicariously absorbed through books and videos of people who'd actually made their way out into the world. Looking back, it was probably a little risky to plan for a future I knew so little about, and dedicating years of my life in pursuit of it. But now I've gotten a taste, and I can imagine myself spending several seasons in the cities I basically sailed through and still have more to see and explore. It's easy to get caught up in your own little comfortable corner of reality, forgetting that there's a whole world full of ideas and perspectives and cultures that you'll never experience if you don't dive into them. I've said before that I enjoy stepping outside my comfort zone, and being dropped in a country where I can barely tell the bathrooms apart was certainly a great way to do that. So on that front, it was nice to see reality lining up with my goals.</p>
<p>There's this weird dichotomy that exists with planning things. I like to be spontaneous and leave myself flexible for anything that may pop up, yet I'm planning details for things ten years down the road. It's confusing, to be sure. I recognize that I'm not the same Brandon I was two years ago, and that Brandon was different than a Brandon from two years prior. I'm an undulating, four dimensional stream of Brandons being shaped by my own ideas and environment, trying to figure out what makes sense to do with the one shot I get at this whole "life" thing.* I can't expect that Brandon ten years from now will be anything like The Brandon I Am Now&#8482;, except for hopefully a few guiding principles. Trying to setup for a future is dangerous like that, and the best I can do is open as many doors as possible while I'm young so that all I'll have to do is pick one when the time comes.</p>
<p><sub><em>*Reading this over, it sounds like I'm stoned out of my mind, rambling on about the universe and higher dimensions. I can assure you that that isn't the case, but looking out over a stunning skyscape above a glimmering Greenland will do strange things to your perspective.</em></sub></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I know, I know, I don't write as often as I used to. I have an excuse or two for this week though, I swear. Between helping a friend move, drinking some <a href="http://www.puzzledpint.com/">Puzzled Pints</a>, volunteering with <a href="http://www.destinationimagination.org/">Destination Imagination</a>, trying out (and struggling with) yoga and swing dancing (not at the same time), celebrating the <a href="http://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/festivals/spring-festival/chinese-zodiac-years-of-2011-to-2020.htm">Chinese New Year</a>, and biking 50 miles to watch the Super Bowl with friends, I've been a reasonably busy bus bum. I also have a ton of half-finished posts that are just waiting for me to get my act together and polish them off, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Anyway, people seemed curious as to how my daily routine plays out, so here is a play-by-play of what my (surprisingly normal) work week looks like.</p>
<h2>My Weekday</h2>
<p><em>5:00 - 6:00 am</em> <strong>Wake up.</strong> I use an alarm clock app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&amp;hl=en">Sleep as Android</a>, which I talked a little bit about <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5733935958982656">in this post</a>. The gist of it is this: I place my phone on the bed next to me, and it takes accelerometer measurements while I sleep. Based on these measurements and some combination of magic and science, it can try its darnedest and guess if I'm in light sleep, as opposed to deep sleep or REM sleep. If it's between five and six in the morning, and it catches me in light sleep, the alarm will go off. If I sleep soundly til six, it'll wake me up then. Considering sleep cycles are anywhere between <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/science/what/sleep-patterns-rem-nrem">70 and 120 minutes</a>, it's likely that I'll be in light sleep somewhere in the hour. In my experience, the alarm normally senses my wakefulness around 5:30, at which point I get up feeling pretty grog-free<sup>if that's a real expression</sup>. I blink a few times and stretch out before rallying myself onto my feet and stumbling around in the dark. Eventually I find my best (read: only) pair of athletic shoes, normally by tripping over them. I work my way over to the back gate and hit the lights, then remove the vice grips I use to keep the door locked. I toss my already-packed gym bag over my shoulder, and (quietly) open up the back gate to head over to the gym.</p>
<p><em>6:00 - 7:30 am</em> <strong>Exercise.</strong> I've mentioned before that I'm doing three-week cycles of a modified 5/3/1 routine. This means that Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday are press, squat, bench, and deadlift days, respectively. Wednesday is a toss up, but it usually involves me sleeping in, forcing myself to do cardio, or targeting core and underutilized muscles (calves, trapezius, lower back, etc). Normally, I set aside the last 10-20 minutes for stretching, foam rolling, and the inversion table. At some point in the near future, I'll have a week exclusively for working on personal records and one-rep maxes; my goal is to have a combined bench, squat, and deadlift of 850 pounds. I'll follow up my attempts with a post.</p>
<p><em>7:30 - 8:00 am</em> <strong>Making myself pretty.</strong> By the time I'm done with my workout, I'm normally a hot, sweaty, angry*, solemn mess, which doesn't translate well into maintaining positive relationships with coworkers. Sounds like something that could be (and is) perfectly solved by a hot shower. My morning prettification looks something like: shower, brush teeth, throw on the carefully folded clothes from my gym bag, send a few "you got this" looks to myself in the mirror, and head over to my office.</p>
<p><em>8:00 - 8:30 am</em> <strong>Breakfast.</strong> Normally I'll grab the undisputed most important meal of the day with a coworker or two. I do my best to refrain from talking about truck stuff unless someone explicitly brings it up. Even though the cat is oh-so out of the proverbial bag at this point, I recognize that most of my life outside of work is still weird as hell to reasonable people. Even if they can understand why I do it, there's no reason to constantly remind them that I make highly questionable decisions &#8212; it's really just self-preservation for when performance reviews roll around. As for the food that I spend a continuous half an hour shoveling into my face, I spring for some combination of scrambled eggs, Greek yogurt, fresh fruit, and a bran muffin. Boring yes, but not unpleasant, and it's way better than dying of any number of maintenance-related ailments before I have a chance to travel the world.</p>
<p><em>8:30 am - 4:30(ish) pm</em> <strong>Work and more food.</strong> My actual day job consists me arguing with computers and being aggressively indecisive about which mode I want my sit/stand desk in, which I'm sure annoys my coworkers. I take breaks for lunch and occasionally to have a cup of tea on the roof if it's particularly nice out, because it's important to stop once in a while and recognize all the wonderful things we have in our lives. I make a <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5768755258851328">conscious effort</a> to make sure I'm not working too much, and head out when my work has reached a logical break point.</p>
<p><em>4:30 - 8:30(ish) pm</em> <strong>Everything else.</strong> After work, I'll usually have some event planned for myself, like checking my mailbox, grabbing dinner with friends, or any of the things I mentioned at the beginning of this post. I like to have things figured out in advance, because I'm sure as hell not sitting in a small metal box for four hours on top of the eight I already sleep there. If I haven't planned anything, I'll grab my bike and find a quiet place to work on this blog or any of my other pet projects.</p>
<p><em>8:30 - 9:30(ish) pm</em> <strong>Bed time.</strong> I share a bed time with toddlers and the obscenely old. I'm a morning person, and I have been for the past four or five years. It works particularly well with truck life, because it means I'm normally not accidentally scaring the hell out of poor, unsuspecting passers-by when I crawl out of my truck-dungeon. The obvious downside is that when I want to go out on the weekends, I find myself nodding off at the bar, passively grunting to feign engagement in a conversation like the zombified, half-conscious shell of a human being I am by 10 pm. Anyhow, when it's time to hit the hay, I'll grab my gym bag from my desk, wash up in a (preferably single-occupant) restroom, and head over to my truck. My nightly truck-routine consists of me tossing the old gym clothes into my laundry bag, loading in new clothes for the next day, calculating and filling in the weights for tomorrow's workout in my log, and measuring out protein powder like a discount <a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/epicrapbattlesofhistory/images/a/ac/Breaking-bad-rv-wallpaper-1600x900.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140522120132">Walter White</a>. Once everything is in order, the vice grips go back on the back gate, I plug my phone into my battery pack and open up my alarm app, and curl up under the warmth of my cozy blankets and <a href="https://www.groupon.com/deals/gg-shavel-micro-flannel-heat-reflecting-mattress-pad">heat-reflective mattress pad</a>. I've actually ditched all the gear from <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5158086071287808">this post</a>, as my blankets are far more than warm enough.</p>
<p><em>9:30 pm - 5:30(ish) am</em> <strong>Sleep like a small child.</strong> Unless I'm sleeping in an unfamiliar place, I normally pass out pretty quickly and sleep soundly through the night.</p>
<h2>Analyzing the Routine</h2>
<p>What would be the point of having a routine if I wasn't content with it? Sure, it's nice to have structure and regimentation in your daily life, it undoubtedly makes things go more smoothly. In the end though, it's all utterly useless if you aren't enjoying it. To me, finding comfort and complacency in a monotonous rut sounds like the most efficient way to watch your life pass you by. Luckily, I don't feel that's my case, and overall, I'm pretty happy with my routine. Waking up early minimizes the likelihood that I'll somehow annoy someone with my truck activities, and my nearly non-existent commute means I spend more of my time doing things I actually care about, like this blog and hanging out with friends (as opposed to simultaneously killing the environment and my ability to enjoy life). Not having a shower or place to safely store food means I'm forced to be consistent with my diet and exercise. I normally come back every month or two and make sure my life is still aligned with my goals, and make changes as necessary. From where I'm standing (err, sitting) right now, life is good and exactly where I need it to be.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">Hey, workouts are a great way to channel all your negativity into something productive, maybe even cathartic.</em></p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I've <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5681717746597888">discussed my homelessness</a> on here before, but  between <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5732694713434112">my camping trip</a> a few months back and my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5669283816275968">early retirement revelation</a>, I now have a whole new lens to examine it under.</p>
<h2>Getting Nostalgic*</h2>
<p>So let's take it back more than 12,500 years: humans aren't doing anything productive. We're hunter-gatherers, we set up camp near wherever we think the food (berries, plants, and huntable animals) will be at. We build simple structures to protect ourselves from the elements, but we take them down and start over somewhere else when the food supply dwindles. Most of our time and energy is put towards the highly productive task of not-dying.</p>
<p>It isn't until we get our collective act together and develop agriculture about 12,500 years ago that we actually settle down in one place and make permanent homes. Here, homes still have the purpose of protection from Nature's hissy fits, but also act as more durable places to set up shop for the long haul. So people build settlements, but naturally there's not a ton of infrastructure; it's not like you can ride 50 miles in any direction and still have your daily Starbucks latte. Anchored to their large slash-and-burn farms, people tend not to move around much, barring war or particularly malevolent acts of nature.</p>
<h2>How 'bout Now?</h2>
<p>A lot has changed in the past decade or thousand. It took two days of me lounging around in a tent to realize that we have the luxury of an unprecedented level of mobility. Long before home ownership became something to check off of the "American Dream Bucket List," homes were just a place to not die, conveniently positioned near your farm and the rest of your relevant infrastructure. In this wondrous modern era, resources like food, water, plumbing, electricity, and even Internet are more or less ubiquitous in most of the desirable parts of the planet, and we have the modern miracles of cars and planes to travel to them. This means that, for certain lifestyles, the home can take a position of obsolescence. Anecdotally, I had no problem leaving everything (not that there was much to leave) behind for a weekend, and settling down 200 miles away with nothing more than a wallet and a bag of clothes. That's a big difference from 12,000 years ago: if you packed your bags and traveled 200 miles you'd likely find yourself 200 miles from the nearest human being, and you'd make some nice puppy chow for a pack of wolves. More comfortingly, now that humanity has settled pretty much everywhere and bent nature to our will, we have all the allowances of modern life all over the place, with a greatly reduced risk for puppy-chow-ification.</p>
<p>The reason we don't take advantage of our profound mobility is obvious: we've cast our anchors. We're anchored to our jobs, to our families, to our weekend tennis club meetups, and even to the piles of stuff we've been accumulating in garages, sheds, desk drawers, and cabinets. For the majority of people (who by and large are not travelling salesmen), it's completely unfeasible to dig this ever-more massive anchor out of the mud it's so firmly embedded in. Who would have thought that a basement full of forgotten Christmas presents would be a modern day Excalibur?</p>
<h2>Loosening The Sword</h2>
<p>I'm making a very conscious effort to make sure my life doesn't play out like the scene I set above. While the truck is still my "home", the traditional idea of home plays a much less important role in my life. Yes, I'm still anchored to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area">Bay</a> by my job, but if all <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5669283816275968">goes to plan</a>, that'll only be the case for a proportionally short period of time.</p>
<p>When I first set out on this journey eight months ago, I thought <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5689792285114368">I had it all figured out.</a> I was going to truck it up for a few years, and then spend six <em>whole</em> months travelling before returning to work for the next 30-odd years. This was before I knew about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study">Trinity study</a> and withdrawal rates and 401k's and HSAs and IRAs (oh my). But now, with everything falling into alignment, it seems silly that I thought six months would be enough time to do all the travelling I've spent my youth dreaming about. How could I possibly see everything there is to see when travelling 500 miles in any direction might as well be a new planet?</p>
<p>I guess I was worried that if I didn't travel soon, I'd never do it at all. But, if a bit of delayed gratification is all it takes to turn a six month trip into a lifelong adventure, I'm more than on-board. Plus, now that I'm more settled in my job, I'm finding that I <em>do</em> get to do a fair bit of work travel (in fact I'll be visiting two countries next month alone). My work-sanctioned excursions will be more than enough to tide me over until I can make travelling a full-time job. Then, I won't even have to drag up my anchor (since I'm hellbent on keeping this metaphor going). I'll just quietly cast the chain overboard and watch it sink down as I drift off into the sunset.</p>

<em>Source: <span>This weird stock photo brought to you by Google Image Search and <a href="http://rightquestion.org/blog/inquiring-minds-4/">Right Question</a>.</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>This Q&amp;A is a total potpourri of everything I've gotten in the past month (or three), but I've done my best to group them together.</p>
<h2>Relationships and&#8230;Personal Matters</h2>
<p><em><strong>Do you have a girlfriend? What does she think of your lifestyle?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't have a girlfriend at the moment, so her opinions are nonexistent. If I <em>were</em> to have a girlfriend, I'd like to think that she'd be (at the very least) accepting of my choices. I'm pretty contented with the way my life is right now though, which is to say that I'm not in the market for a relationship at the moment. I don't want to say that I'll never have a serious relationship while living in the truck, because I have no idea how long I'll be doing this. But I definitely understand how ridiculous everything about my life looks From Outside The Box&#8482;, from the perspective of a reasonable person who has their affairs in order.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you do get laid in the box, will you disclose this information on your blog (leaving out names and identifying details of course)?</strong></em></p>
<p>Absolutely not, and I say that with the utmost confidence. I've chosen a lifestyle that dramatically reduces my chances of getting laid, I hardly think I'd be improving them if potential suitors thought I was going to recount my box truck (s)exploits for the Internet's perusal and entertainment. I'm also just not the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kiss+and+tell">kiss and tell</a> type, as part of my Try Not To Be A Douchebag&#8482; credo. On top of all these things, that's like a whole 'nother level of illegal. Like, we're talking sex-offender-registry-illegal, and for obvious reasons I have no intention of opening up that bag of worms <strong>and then proceeding to brag about it in a place accessible to the entirety of the Internet-connected planet</strong>.</p>
<h2>Bike/Exercise Stuff</h2>
<p><em><strong>Are you going to the San Jose bike party tonight (11-20-15)?</strong></em></p>
<p>I did actually read this on November 20<sup>th</sup> (you can tell I'm pretty awful at answering questions in a timely fashion), but tragically I already had plans at that point. But thanks for letting me know those exist, I'll definitely make it to one eventually, especially now that I'm upping the ante with my bike trips.</p>
<p><em><strong>Have you considered one of those eBike conversion kits that turn a regular bicycle into an eBike?</strong></em></p>
<p>I (very briefly) considered it, then decided otherwise. As I mentioned at the end of <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5753952654065664">this post</a>, an electric bike is <em>actually worse</em> for rides over 25 miles (which I've been doing a bunch of) because of the whole range thing. Plus, the logistics of how/when/where I charge the bike are pretty nebulous on weekends because I can't exactly plug it into the truck, and it takes 5+ hours to fully charge. Also, if I want my cardio to eventually not holistically suck, a normal bike that forces me to do actual work will whip me into shape much quicker than a glorified moped.</p>
<p><em><strong>How's the new bicycle?</strong></em></p>
<p>The new bicycle is doing wonderfully, thank you for asking! I've taken it on several rides that left my legs in a state of matter somewhere between solid and liquid, and it's holding up nicely (unlike my legs). I replaced the left crank arm and picked up some lights, but that was really all the TLC it needed to be in tip-top road-ready shape.</p>
<p><em><strong>How's the gym going?</strong></em></p>
<p>The gym is going well. I've been doing a modified version of <a href="https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/hardcore-look-at-jim-wendlers-5-3-1-powerlifting-system.html">Jim Wendler's 5/3/1</a> program, and I've finished 11 3-to-4 week cycles of that since starting work. The good thing is that almost every cycle still has new personal records, but I'm starting to see plateaus in press and bench. Eventually I'll do a detailed fitness post.</p>
<h2>The Current State of Affairs</h2>
<p><em><strong>So your employer has told you you have to leave their parking lot. What solution did you come up with? | What's your current sitch? You left us hanging when you got the boot. | Where do you live now? Still in your truck? |  Are you going to tell us how is going there? Do you like your neighbors, how has your commute and daily life changed?</strong></em></p>
<p>A lot of people seem curious as to how I'm managing my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5647308616105984">effective eviction</a>. If I've learned literally anything from it, it's that I need to keep my obnoxiously large mouth slightly less agape. So as an exercise in restraint, I won't be talking much about my current living situation. I will say, however, that I'm still a vehicular vagrant, and all of the reasons I do what I do are still valid. My day-to-day life is virtually unchanged.</p>
<h2>Everything Else</h2>
<p><em><strong>How do you prevent the doors from being locked while you are inside the truck?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't. If someone <em>really</em> wanted, they could come up and tie or otherwise lock the hitch down to the frame of the truck, and I'd be pretty screwed. I'm sure if I called one of my friends (I get fine cell reception), they'd come over with a knife or scissors or the Jaws of Life or something and save my life. Honestly, I couldn't even be mad because I've been wildly negligent in preventing it from happening, despite knowing the risk. I'd find it pretty funny (and learn my lesson), just because of how ridiculous the whole situation would be. It's pretty rare that someone gets locked <em>in</em> their home. It'd be worth it for the story, if nothing else.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you play video games?</strong></em></p>
<p>Nope. I own a non-gaming laptop and a phone, neither of which are conducive to gaming. The last game I got really into was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a>, and I haven't played that in four or five years.</p>
<p><em><strong>Would you consider installing a Tesla Powerwall in the truck?</strong></em></p>
<p>Is that you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon</a>? In the <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5750085036015616">past</a>, I've talked about potentially getting some sort of electricity source, like a Duracell Powerpack. The idea is that I'd charge it up with a (roof-mounted?) solar panel, and then I could use it to power&#8230;something? I really don't have anything that would benefit from a constant AC power supply, everything electronic I own is battery-powered, by design. So if I don't need that, I <strong>definitely</strong> don't need a Tesla Powerwall, which, doing some quick math, stores <strong>~40x</strong> energy and takes up <strong>~8x</strong> the space.* Plus I think I'd also need an actual earth ground, like, a wire from the Powerwall that just leads straight into the ground, though I'm not entirely certain about this. In a home, that's not really an issue (1. Dig hole. 2. Insert wire.), but it sounds like a weird and potentially dangerous thing to try with the truck.</p>
<p><em><strong><sub>*And that's not including the inverter I'd undoubtedly have to install too.</sub></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Have you read Thoreau's Walden? What about The Martian?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm in the process of reading both. Okay fine, you caught me, I'm actually listening to an audiobook for <em>The Martian</em>. Thanks to everyone who suggested I read them, <em>Walden</em> in particular is giving me a lot to mull over, so expect a future post on all of the ways that <em>Walden</em> is timeless and relevant to a truck guy.</p>

<p><em>Do you think a female going to grad school could survive your adventure? My daughter is 25 and is going to grad school next year.</em></p>
<p>Normally I would drop a question like this into a Q&amp;A post of some sort, but I've gotten a bunch of similar questions, and even met up with a few inquirers to discuss this exact topic. These things lead me to believe it's an important enough topic to deserve its own post (not that the threshold for <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5684049913839616">"deserving a post"</a> is very high). The question is a simple one:</p>
<p class="text-center"><em>Could I get rid of my house or apartment and live out of a vehicle?</em></p>
<h2>The Simple Answer</h2>
<p>A simple answer would just be: Yes. Barring any harsh health conditions/completely crippling poverty, most people could buy a sleeping bag and throw it in the back of their car. Even if you don't have a car to begin with, I'm sure you could sign a few papers with some questionable, semi-savory people and find yourself in a vehicle pretty quickly. Congratulations, you live in a car.</p>
<p>Even that's not so bad though. In fact, if you trace your lineage back, you'll find that you have 200,000 years (give or take a few tens of thousands of years) worth of ancestors wandering around in the woods. This makes you, with your sleeping bag and car, more equipped for braving the elements than thousands of generations before you. Grab a few Happy Meals a day, and maybe a gym membership if you care about how you smell, and you should be all set for the long haul.</p>
<p>But obviously there's much more than that, and I'm just being facetious for the sake of wanting to use the word <em>facetious</em> in a sentence correctly. My above ramblings aren't taking into consideration things like comfort, adequate hygiene, and <em>real</em> food, not to mention that people will probably think you're crazy. I'm sure there are a few other things on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Mazlow's Hierarchy of Needs</a> that I'm missing too. So what does it really take to live out of a vehicle?</p>
<h2>A <sup><sub>Slightly</sub></sup> More Reasonable <sup><sub>But Still Ridiculous</sub></sup> Answer</h2>
<p>Making the decision to live out of a vehicle is a pretty big one. I had the luxury of spending 8+ months weighing out the <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5741031244955648">pros and cons</a> of the lifestyle change, and despite all of that incubation time, I was still having second thoughts even as I was signing the papers to purchase the truck I now call home. I've never really written about this before, but I vividly remember the feeling of closing my apartment door for the last time, knowing that I wouldn't have a fixed place to turn to from there on out. There's not much you can do to prepare for something like that, and I'm sure the uncertainty and chaos are even more biting when you don't make the decision willingly. It's one of those "here goes everything" kind of moments, which can be a blessing or a curse depending on your attitude.</p>
<h3>Mindset</h3>
<p>I legitimately enjoy living out of my truck, as I've undoubtedly mentioned a hundred-and-one times before. It's simple, liberating, and occasionally challenging, but part of the fun in this lifestyle is finding creative solutions to weird problems. I like that I'm not wasting a very non-negligible part of my life commuting. I like that I'm not wasting resources that I don't need. And that's the thing, I <em>like</em> doing this, and that's what makes it feasible for me. If you go into something like this thinking that it's some huge sacrifice, it's going to feel like a chore. You can kind of see this in the wording of the initial question above. Instead of trying to <strong>survive</strong> this adventure, one might even <strong>enjoy</strong> it or <strong>benefit</strong> from it. I understand that people find the idea attractive because of its cost-cutting benefits, but the whole experience will be a much smoother, more savory adventure if you go into it with the right mindset. Thinking that you're going to "grit your teeth and do it" is setting yourself up for burnout, if nothing worse. It can be a lot of fun, it definitely doesn't need to be taken so seriously.</p>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>As with most non-luck-based things in life, your ability to live in a truck hinges on your ability to plan things out. Off the top of my head, some questions you're going to need to be able to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What kind of car do you want?</strong> The type of vehicle you get is entirely contingent on what type of person you are and what you need out of life. I've seen people living in everything from the bed of a pickup truck to a cushy 40' RV. Looking <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5668600916475904">back</a> to when I was planning everything out, I thought I wanted some type of sprinter or conversion van. It took a bit of introspection before I realized that I personally wanted a little more space, more of a canvas to work with. Search around and try to find something that fits in with the lifestyle you want, each vehicle will undoubtedly have its own special set of trade-offs. For example, the box truck is large and awkward to maneuver, but it blends in more than an RV, and that's a balance I'm willing to work with.</li>
<li><strong>Where are you going to get the car?</strong> Once you've figured out the type of car you want, you'll naturally have to figure out where you're getting it from. Check <a href="http://craigslist.org">Craigslist</a>, check local dealerships, check <a href="http://www.kbb.com/">Kelly Blue Book</a>, check that site your aunt told you was great. Whatever it is, just do your research. Remember, you're literally shopping for a home, it's in your best interest to put a little time and effort into it.</li>
<li><strong>Where are you going to park it?</strong> Will it be safe to park it at work? Is a friend going to let you park it in their driveway? What do the vagrancy laws look like in your neck of the woods? This is another area that might require a bit of research.</li>
<li><strong>Where are you going to shower and go to the bathroom?</strong> Bathhouse, gym, school, work: all valid options. Just make sure you have something available to you. I've said it before and it bears repeating: you definitely don't get to skimp on the hygiene just because you're skimping on traditional housing. If you don't think you'll be capable of keeping up appearances, so to speak, don't move into a truck. Other parts of your life will suffer as a result, and it will be sad and not worth it.</li>
<li><strong>Where are you going to eat and store food?</strong> One of the great inconveniences of being a living creature is that we have to take time out of our busy days to eat food. If you're living in a car to cut your expenses down, it doesn't make a lot of sense to be constantly eating out. You either need a place to store food, or some method of procuring it. I'm fortunate enough to be able to eat most of my meals at work, but I understand that's certainly not the norm. My senior year of college, I experimented with a <a href="http://www.spacenutrientsstation.com/buy">Soylent-like</a> meal-replacement shake, as part of a bodybuilding routine I was doing. It's certainly not for everyone (and I occasionally found myself missing the sensation of <em>chewing</em>), but it's fairly cheap (~$3 a bottle), easy to store in a vehicle, and only requires water to consume. Something worth considering.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Everything Else</h3>
<p>Check out <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5738600293466112">this post</a> if you haven't seen it already &#8212; it covers all the things that make it possible for me to do what I do. That said, plenty of people live in cars and don't have the same resources available to them that I do. I'm sure there are more creative solutions to the various facets and challenges of truck life that haven't even crossed my mind, and figuring them out is part of the journey.</p>
<h3>One Final Note</h3>
<p>Throughout this post, I've been ignoring one of the keywords from the initially-posed question: <em>female</em>. The world can be a scary place, filled with less-than-savory people. I know several women that live in vehicles, and they haven't told me about any major problems with other people. Still, my anecdotes don't necessarily align with the larger reality, and crime statistics will paint a decidedly less cheery picture. I live in a place with incredibly low crime-rates, and if it came down to it, I'm pretty confident in my ability to defend myself (hell, I didn't even lock my truck door for the first six or so months). Regardless of my personal feelings, safety concerns certainly can (and should) be a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>To end on a less somber note: truck life can be fun and rewarding, and will likely leave you with some unique skills and life experiences. And this particular trucker just finished his <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5640471028170752">aforementioned</a> defensive driving course and sent in the paperwork, hopefully saving his license once and for all.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Remember <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5172785596858368">when I got a <strong>bad</strong> speeding ticket, thought I was going to lose my license, and then luckily did not end up losing my license</a>? Well as luck/fate/chance/happenstance would have it, that turned out not to be the end of the story.</p>
<p><em>Brandon, what are you talking about? You said you called up the California DMV and they said everything was fine, what gives?</em></p>
<p>I <em>did say</em> everything was fine, because I <em>did think</em> everything was fine. Like the Overly Cheerful DMV Lady said was going to happen, I got a letter in the mail that said, without a doubt, the California DMV had no intentions of taking away my license. It wasn't until I stopped into the DMV this past Thursday to get my motorcycle license that I found out anything was wrong.</p>
<p>I debated weaving out the intricate web of sadness and bureaucracy that took place that fateful Thursday into its own little story, but I decided against it because it's mind-numbingly boring and it physically pains me to recount the conversations that I had with various three-letter agencies in all of their vivid, nonsensical glory. So I'll just give you the <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/">SparkNotes</a> version, which goes a little like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brandon wanders into California DMV.</li>
<li>CA DMV says, "Sorry, something is wrong in the system and we can't give you a motorcycle license, call the Massachusetts RMV."</li>
<li>Brandon calls MA RMV.</li>
<li>MA RMV tells Brandon that he never took the course.</li>
<li>Brandon has never heard of the course.</li>
<li>MA RMV explains to Brandon that he has to take a course because of his ticket.</li>
<li>Brandon inquires why he hasn't heard of this course.</li>
<li>MA RMV says they mailed it to his old address, which was invalid.</li>
<li>Brandon inquires why they didn't send it to the address he's been using for 8 months, especially after realizing the old address was invalid.</li>
<li>MA RMV doesn't have an answer, but explains that they're going to tell California to take away Brandon's license because he didn't take the course and is reaching the end of the (apparently 90-day) grace period. MA RMV instructs Brandon to call the National Safety Council.</li>
<li>Brandon calls NSC.</li>
<li>NSC agrees that this whole scenario is ridiculous, and gives Brandon a list of four (in the entirety of California) sketchy locations where he can take the course. None of them are within an hour drive.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's where I am right now. Luckily (or unluckily, depending on your perspective), I'm going to LA with a few friends this upcoming long weekend, and can take the course once I'm down there&#8230;while my friends ride rollercoasters at <a href="https://www.knotts.com/">Knott's Berry Farm</a>. In the end, it's still entirely my fault for getting the speeding ticket in the first place, but the course is clearly designed for people in negligent accidents or repeated violations. Oh well. I'll take the course, pay another $xxx on top of the $470 I've already paid, and move on with my life.</p>
<p>One thing I've noticed is that I'm decidedly less terrified this time around. Last time, I remember my heart rate shooting up and panicking over what I was going to do, and that just wasn't there this time. The consequences are still the same as before, potentially losing my license and home, but for some reason it isn't scary anymore. I'm not sure if it's because I've already <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5647308616105984">made the leap</a> and moved off campus, or I'm just getting better at handling weird truck-related strife in all its flavors. In any case, I think it's a good thing, and I await the next strange twist of fate with open arms, and an open back roll-up gate.</p>

<em>Source: <span>My signature "look off into the distance and feign deep thought" look. The "deep thought" is about truck stuff like 46% of the time. This was at my company holiday party a few weeks ago, thus the general festive-ness.</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><em>On the <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5647308616105984">last episode</a> of From Inside the Box, we found our pickup truck protagonist in the throes of a struggle for survival: not of flesh, but of his very livelihood. Where will he go? What will he do? Will he ever understand why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch&#8482;? Find out <del>on this episode</del> eventually&#8230;maybe.</em></p>
<p>Just kidding. I don't plan to talk about any of those things today. Instead, we're going to talk about poor decisions, getting in the holiday spirit, and how any of that relates to truck stuff. Oh, and apologies for my silence and general tardiness with getting new posts out, rest assured that there are more in the pipeline (tech, home improvement, and philosophy, oh my!). But anyway, let's see what the past two (fairly truckless) weeks have been like.</p>
<h2>Flying Home: The Story of Las Vegas</h2>
<p>I'd been planning to go home for the two weeks leading up to (and including) New Years, but it wasn't until I actually sat down to look at the flights that something interesting happened. The best (read: cheapest) flight that I could find had a 30-hour layover in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas">Las Vegas</a>. For the uninitiated, Vegas is basically the physical manifestation of every American stereotype, magnified a hundred times over. It proudly exploits every human failing and mortal vice, packaged together and wrapped with lights, hundred dollar bills, liquor, and strip clubs. It's grandiose, excessive, wasteful to the point of comedy, and stands boastfully in the face of everything I believe in.</p>
<p><em>Brandon, if you knew all of this, why the hell did you even go? Plus, it may have been the cheapest flight, but that's not counting the cost of being in Vegas and the hotel room.</em></p>
<p>Well that's the thing. I was <em>curious</em>, and despite knowing how well that worked out for the cat, I wanted to get a closer look. And as far as the hotel goes, I had this crazy idea that I just wouldn't get one. My (later proven to be bad) thought process was something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote><p>I've spent the past <del>six</del> seven months without legitimate housing, what's one more night? Vegas is the city that never sleeps (or something like that), I'll just stay up and explore, then crash at the airport before my flight.</p>
<p><em>-A two-week younger Brandon</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It sounded like a plan to me (at the time), so I booked the flight.</p>
<p>When my Friday flight rolled around, I went about my morning routine as normal. Gym, shower, get dressed, etc, but then instead of heading into work, I headed back to the truck* to pack my bag. Just like when I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5732694713434112">went camping</a>, packing (even for two weeks) proved to be a breeze, and I quickly left my truck with nothing more than a small gym bag. I should mention that I'm still dealing with a <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5740423507083264">residual leak</a> that I haven't tracked down yet, so I put a garbage bag underneath the affected area to (hopefully) catch any little dribbles. On returning this past Sunday night, I found a bit of water in the bag, though not nearly as much as I was expecting given the rain we had here while I was gone. This means one of two things: water wasn't making it into the bag, or my various <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5740423507083264">hole-fixing</a> endeavors are paying off. More research is required.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nTVF1GJbhaJGdy1j7bYhrdZXMvk9YmX8Zdu76ZsxyDO_js6jiktHSfC8pWOEos4z1wqCK-4uNBLVaedRfFjhIUQBBdaLNNJmRkg2vw=s350"/>
<p>My less-than-elegant answer to El Ni&#241;o.</p>
</div>
<h3>Onwards, To Vegas</h3>
<p>Whilst in my <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> on the way to the airport, I called my bank and asked them to limit withdrawals from my account to $500 for the next few days. I figured that'd last me the night in Vegas, and prevent a drunker, more ambitious version of me from emptying out my accounts (which did indeed happen).</p>
<p><em>Hold up, I could have sworn you <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5669283816275968">recently said</a> you were saving for an early retirement? What the hell are you doing going to Vegas?</em></p>
<p>I know, I know, Vegas is the last place on the planet I should be if I'm super serious about retiring early, and I can feel the intense disapproval of <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mustachians</a> everywhere. Even with my limited understanding of statistics, I knew I was never going to see that $500 again (spoiler alert: It's definitely gone), but I wasn't treating this like an investment strategy. I could try to justify it with the unexpected $500 bonus I got a few weeks ago, but that could have just as easily been put to <em>literally anything else</em>. I'm thinking of it more like $500 spent on a once in a lifetime experience**. And I'm very much one for <em>experiences</em> over <em>stuff</em>, so this was an an expense I was willing to foot the bill for.</p>
<p>After a few short hours of people-watching (a favorite pastime of mine) in SFO, I found myself enjoying the modern marvel of human aviation. Once I landed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran_International_Airport">LAS</a>, I grabbed a shuttle into town and dropped my gym bag off at a random hotel on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip">The Strip</a>, then it was off to the (proverbial, but also kind of literal) races. It didn't take me long to get acquainted; a slot machine devoured my first $20 in approximately 15 seconds. I definitely wasn't in <del>Kansas</del> the relative financial safety of my truck anymore. I figured the best 2:1 odds I'd find were ~47%, playing Roulette. My $500 turned into $1,000, which then turned into a whopping $0 over the course of a few hours, but that's Vegas.</p>
<p>I spent the remainder of my time making conversation with interesting strangers (good), getting far too drunk at several different open-bar clubs (bad), and wandering the (fairly cold) streets of Las Vegas from roughly 3 to 8 AM while waiting until I could go to the airport (very bad). That last one in particular really killed the whole "Vegas experience" for me, partly because cold, hungover, exhausted Brandon isn't a happy Brandon, and partly because Vegas is a sad, sad place at 4 in the morning. Homelessness is <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/inside-the-tunnels-las-vegass-homeless-population-calls-home">rampant in Vegas</a>, and that's never more apparent than in the wee hours of the morning. Most of the people I saw seem to have just lost their way in life, but I felt helpless seeing their pain and suffering, especially juxtaposed with the opulence and extravagance of the world around them. The whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>Well that took a turn for the darker. There is a bright side though, in that there are tons of organizations dedicated to fighting homelessness. I've been donating to <a href="https://handup.org/">HandUp</a> recently because I like their approach to solving the problem (in San Francisco) on an individualized basis. Plus, a generous corporate matching initiative more than doubled all donations to that organization last month. As per the article I linked above, <a href="http://www.helpsonv.org/">Help of Southern Nevada</a> orchestrates homeless outreach programs in the Las Vegas area.</p>
<h2>Getting in the Spirit</h2>
<p>Aside from the fact that Christmas music starts playing nonstop a day after Halloween, I love the holidays. Reconnecting with old friends, hanging with family, and drinking obscene amounts of eggnog rank pretty highly on my <em>Things That Definitely Have To Happen While I'm Home And It's Winter</em>&#8482; List. That said, I normally make other peoples' lives difficult because I'm notoriously hard to shop for. I always have everything that I could ever need (and then some), plus this year I live in a truck, so I don't <em>have</em> space for more things, even if I did want them. I consider this to be a good thing, and <em>most</em> people were happy to oblige my request of "Please don't get me anything", understanding that I just wouldn't even know where to put a gift.</p>
<p>I say "most" people, because much to my chagrin, my mother's home was filled with presents of all shapes and sizes, more than a few of which were emblazoned with my name. This put me in a somewhat awkward position. On one hand, I didn't want to be a massive Grinch and tell her to return all of her well-meaning gifts. But on the other hand, I make a very conscious effort to not drag around things I don't need, and I was pretty confident I had everything I needed. Luckily, the issue resolved itself because all of my gifts were very well-thought out. In no particular order, I received:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Top-Gear-Roadside-Assistance-66-piece/dp/B00JHK81X2">Top Gear Premium Roadside Assistance Kit</a></strong> This was pretty much the perfect gift, because it showed me that, as much as I like to think I'm prepared for all reasonable eventualities, I'm actually pretty lacking. Considering I'm someone whose livelihood revolves around the questionable performance of an old box truck, it's mildly shocking that I didn't even own a pair of jumper cables. This was as much a gift as it was a lesson.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/-Flat-S50073-Ultimate-1-Step-Repair/dp/B00PRJI9O8">Tire Repair Kit</a></strong> Right in line with the above, I'd have been pretty screwed in the (not entirely unlikely) event that I got a flat tire.</li>
<li><strong>Various warm and soft articles of clothing</strong> For those times when the weather is <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5158086071287808">slightly less than ideal.</a></li>
<li><strong>A website and accompanying surprise</strong> When asking what I wanted for Christmas, my sister wouldn't take "Nothing" as an answer. I wracked my brain for a little bit, and eventually told her that if she was dead set on getting me a gift, she could make me a website. My reasoning was that taking the time to learn how to program and <em>making</em> a gift is far more meaningful than purchasing something, plus it's a useful skill she'd have for the rest of her life, <em>and</em> it's something for us to bond over, <em><strong>and</strong></em> to top it all off, it doesn't take up my precious, limited truck space. So it sounded like a win-win-win to me. And bless her heart, she totally nailed it. Not only did she make a totally kick-ass website, but she also hid a set of questions in it that, when answered correctly, gave me the combination to a lock box containing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Gear-Smartwatch-Android-Phones/dp/B015JQ60NA">Samsung Gear S2</a>. Clearly I'm not the only one in the family Thinking Inside The Box&#8482;&#174;&#169;.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Reflecting</h2>
<p>All in all, I had a wonderful vacation, and I'm incredibly grateful to have family and friends who are exceptionally supportive (as evident from the thoughtful, relevant gifts) of all the weird stuff that I do. Less importantly, but still certainly worth noting, this vacation marked the longest period of time I'd spent sleeping in Real People Houses&#8482; since May, which meant I had some time to see/remember how the other half (read: 99.8%) live. You'd think this would be an upgrade, but I found myself missing some of the things I've started to take for granted in truck life. For example, I did a lot of couch-surfing with family and friends, and each bed gave me a different set of weird dreams and a different set of weird pains. Sure, given another day or two, I would have <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5659645909663744">adjusted</a> to the new situations, but, as I noted <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5711312218750976">that time I accidentally moved to a different city</a>, the truck is the same regardless of where on the planet it is, which is a nice feature. As weird as it may be, I did occasionally find myself daydreaming about the cozy homeyness of my rickety, riveted residence. So I'm glad to be back, and glad to be starting off a new year with my <del>trusty</del> rusty steel steed by my side.</p>
<p><sub><em>*I had parked the truck in a place where it could safely stay for the two weeks I was home.</em></sub></p>
<p><sub><em>**Mainly because I have no intentions of ever going back.</em></sub></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>It's been two months since I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5655608640405504">opened my large mouth a little too widely</a>, and things have calmed down considerably. I've only received one or two interview requests in the past month (which I've dutifully ignored), and website views have tapered off to a fairly consistent 500 truck-enthusiasts a day. I've been spending my weekends hammering away on a new home improvement project, and enjoying bike rides to events in the area.</p>
<p>So it caught me totally off-guard when I, with little warning (like a few hours), found myself in a <em>very</em> formal meeting, where I was told, in no uncertain terms, that my weird truck shenanigans weren't going to fly anymore. The company parking lot isn't zoned for residential use, and it's illegal for me to be sleeping in it. It's also a liability, and certainly not a burden my company has any reason or obligation to take on.</p>
<p>And now I'm left to answer a (very timely) question I received, one that I'd been mentally dodging for a while:</p>
<p class="text-center"><em>Do you have a backup plan if you have to leave the corporate campus?</em></p>
<h2>What's Next</h2>
<p>The answer to the above question should have been "Yes, of course I have a backup plan!", because a backup plan is literally the first thing I should have prepared. It's not like there was any certainty in my parking situation to begin with, it was <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5668600916475904">based on assumptions</a> and optimism. But, as I'm rapidly learning about myself, I'm not quite as good a planner as I'd hoped I was. Sure, my friends would happily take me in (like the stray dog that I am) while I figure it all out, but why should they have to deal with my completely ridiculous truck-related problems? It's similar to how I felt about <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5713144022302720">dumping my trash</a>, it's not my friends' responsibility in the slightest.</p>
<p>So that leaves me here, sitting in a cafe writing this post, iterating through the various (in reality, just two) options available to me.</p>
<h3>Sell The Truck</h3>
<p>Not happening. I've been far too spoiled by the simplicity, mobility, and regimentation the truck has provided me. I'm not ready to donate part of my life to a soul-killing commute. I'm in the best shape of my life because of my strict, truck-necessitated workout schedule and weekend bike rides. I like that my whole life fits in a parking space. I like the deafening sound of pouring rain on my thin metal rooftop just as much as I like falling asleep to the sound of crickets. I like being able to tear apart the walls and put them back together again on a whim in the name of "Home Improvement". I want to be able to live in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5711312218750976">random places</a> for a night just because it's convenient. I like always living just outside my comfort zone. And yes, I like being able to fast-track my retirement and earn my complete freedom.</p>
<h3>Redefine Home</h3>
<p>As you can probably guess from the paragraph above, I'm clearly not ready, willing, or able to sell the truck. Instead, I'm going to step outside my comfort zone, and move my truck beyond the relative safety of the corporate parking lots. This means I'm a little further from the resources and facilities than I'm used to, but I'll figure it out with time and the slightest bit of planning. Like with everything else in my life, routine and consistency are paramount, and once I settle back into a rhythm, I doubt this hiccup will be an issue. As far as the logistics go, I <em>still</em> haven't been able to find vagrancy codes for the city I live in, though there is a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB718">Senate bill</a> working its way through the system that would invalidate city laws prohibiting sleeping in cars, which I'm naturally rooting for. In the mean time (and really just forever), my best bet for <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5189192371929088">staying out of trouble</a> is to be unobtrusive and out of the way. I'll have to play it by ear for a while, but I have complete faith that everything will (slowly, but surely) work itself out.*</p>
<h2>Brightside</h2>
<p>Being evicted isn't exactly the most pleasant feeling on the planet, especially when I've spent the past few months lulling myself into a false sense of comfort and security. But I'd be kidding myself if I believed for a second I wasn't still the luckiest person on Earth. Human beings have endured so much worse over the course of history. Read literally any statistic on <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats">this page</a> and it'll become imminently clear that even in this day and age, the worst day I have in my whole life won't be as hard as what <strong>billions</strong> of people experience <strong>every day</strong>. For me to sit here and complain and wallow in my own self-pity while a billion children live in poverty would be an incredible display of arrogance, and a complete waste of time and energy. I still have my dream job, I'm still able to live my truck-heavy lifestyle, and I'm surrounded by supportive friends. Hell, my manager even offered me his guest room while I figured everything out, which was above and beyond anything I could have asked for (not that I took him up on it). To ignore all of that and be sad about the drawbacks of my <strong>entirely</strong> self-imposed lifestyle and short-sighted decision-making would be to discount just how truly fortunate I am.</p>
<h2>Looking A Bit Further</h2>
<p>Mistakes are always a good thing as long as you learn something from them, and the lesson I'm learning here is to plan ahead, certainly more than I have been. Having some sort of contingency plan is the key to my situation remaining viable, and one plan that I've been looking at is buying property (along with a couple other truck-minded people) and then parking there. This is a much more long term solution, and there aren't any promising properties available at the moment, but it's something I'm seriously looking at.</p>
<p>Speaking of other truck people, I really owe them an apology that my vocabulary doesn't really have the words for. For years, people at similar companies have been doing the exact things I had been doing up until today. The fact that my company is cracking down two months after I paraded myself around is no coincidence. I don't know why it was so hard for me to keep my mouth shut in the first place, I knew what the consequences could have been (and now are). I guess it's hubris, maybe I thought I had something to prove or needed validation that I what I was doing was right. In any case, the fact that my own egotism has potentially uprooted the lives of others isn't something I'm proud of. I don't have a good solution, but if you're one of those people, please let me know and I'll do whatever I can to help.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I gave <a href="https://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5669283816275968">my spiel</a> about such lightweight topics as money, financial planning, and how I plan to live the rest of my ephemeral human life. Naturally people had some questions and thoughts of their own to contribute, and I'm more than happy to bring those into the mix.</p>
<p><em><strong>Any reason you're using an ETF instead of a mutual fund? I don't see the soundness in the incurring fees on a brokerage account.</strong></em></p>
<p>So I mentioned I'm using <a href="http://vanguard.com">Vanguard</a> for my brokerage account, and (as of now) my investments are in <a href="https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/investments/productoverview?fundId=0968&amp;WT.mc_id=2012FASSearch">VOO</a>. If you look at this handy chart <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/stocksbondscds/feescommissions?wt.srch=1">here</a> and included below for good measure, there are no commissions or fees as long as you're trading Vanguard funds/ETFs.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ypFQwSpdclsGfZeIxSb6NOdBXKOnkHYMWevp6k1odj6JtVSiZdTIzGkKe775Oj5d2A-Wg1u3mh7a9rgM2qnVUD7TsQb91RsZzD0=s500"/>
<p>Vanguard is pretty awesome.</p>
</div>
<p>So between that, and the generally higher expense ratios for actively-managed mutual funds, Vanguard ETFs seem like the better option for me right now. But I'm also the first one to admit that I'm still very actively learning about all this stuff, and I appreciate any and all advice people have to offer.</p>
<p><em><strong>I hope [...] you're not actually going to invest all of you "investment money" in that one ETF.</strong></em></p>
<p>I probably didn't make this clear enough in my money post, but I won't be blindly dumping all my money into the one ETF. While it is diversified, it is still all my money being susceptible to the fluctuations of a single fund. I don't have enough money in my brokerage account to worry about it yet, but I will start picking out other types of funds to invest in once I'm putting serious cash (&gt;$100k) into it . In the mean time, my 401k and HSA are invested in funds that are at the very least not identical to VOO, and 10% of my 401k (which has 10x more money in it than my brokerage account) is invested in bonds, so I'm not putting all my eggs into one basket by any means. I'll likely never pick out my own stocks, but I'll certainly branch out once I have some time to research what my options are. In the mean time, my current mix provides a nice balance of risk/reward.</p>
<p><em><strong>Appreciate you sharing the numbers. What percentage are you spending/saving?</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a tricky one to answer because my spending hasn't been consistent in the slightest. When I was first getting the truck setup, I was really <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=make+it+rain">making it rain</a> on my expenses. Between getting truck-work done, and buying beds, dressers, bikes, clothes, and all the other bare necessities, my weekly spending was easily 10x what it is now. Six months into it, I think I have every large object covered. I can't think of anything I could buy that would make my life better in any meaningful way, and more likely than not, it'd just take up my precious and relatively scarce truck space. All that considered, it's much easier for me to hit my target savings rate (~90%) now as compared to six months ago. My biweekly take-home pay is $1,640.89 (as of now), and I have monthly truck insurance of $70, a music streaming membership for $10, a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account for $7, and a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> server for $5. That leaves me about $60 a week for random leisure spending, which is more than enough for a nice dinner, some drinks, and hanging out at a quiet cafe and typing up blog posts. It'll be easier to consistently hit the target when my income goes up in the New Year (raises, changes to 401k/HSA, etc).</p>
<p><em><strong>How much are you spending on fuel?</strong></em></p>
<p>Not much, especially since <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5743868070854656">I learned</a> I can keep my insurance cheap by driving less than 3,000 miles a year. Sometimes I'll go two weeks or so without driving, and then I'll drive it just to make sure it hasn't died on me/the tires aren't warping. The last time I drove it any significant distance was to help a friend move, and that was about 50 miles round trip. I probably drive, on average, 50 miles a month, so like $15 in gas a month. My bike and a sprinkle of public transportation serve me well for pretty much all the travelling I do in the area.</p>
<p>Back in the good ole college days (like six months ago), I was the proud owner of a 1986 Corvette, which had roughly the same fuel efficiency as my truck, but would probably make a much less comfortable home. Despite costing me a fortune in fuel, insurance, and repairs, I'm glad to have had it: at least I was able to get <del>all</del> most of the crazy, testosterone-loaded joyrides out of my system before entering the real world. It's strange to think I went from one extreme (loud, gas guzzling, male compensation machine) to the other extreme (long quiet scenic leg-powered bike rides) in such a short time. Hell, Last Year Brandon&#8482; would have painted the front fender a fresh coat of cherry red with bicyclists like Present Day Brandon&#8482;. I blame the change on California and a life philosophy shaped by six months with The Truck.</p>

<p>The love of my life, Yvette.</p>
</div>
<p><em><strong>In your savings clock, are you including the amount you spend on your various Home Improvement projects?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm not, and that may skew the numbers a little bit. That said, even the largest of my past and current Home Improvement projects hasn't cost me more than $100 (plus my time). I ignore smaller things like this in my calculation for simplicity, but also because it balances out other random costs of existing that my situation doesn't necessitate. For example, if I had an apartment, I'd likely be paying for some combination of water, electricity, and Internet, and I'd probably buy some food just so my refrigerator wasn't so lonely. At the end of it all, the savings clock is a very rough approximation, but rent and truck insurance are the dominating terms in the equation, and the rest is just noise.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>It's been long enough.</p>
<p>I took my sweet time getting around to actually <em>doing</em> it, and then almost another month on top of <em>that</em> to start writing this post about it, but we're here now.* And that's what really matters, right?</p>
<p>So anyway, you might remember "The Hole" from <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5634387206995968">that time</a> that birds <strong>always</strong> insisted on pecking at it, or <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5678807906254848">that other time</a> that I MacGyver'd a drainage solution to avoid waking up in a truck-shaped rainwater swimming pool. Looking back, I had every intention of paying another human being money to fix this particular problem. That all changed once I received an email from Nancy (over at <a href="http://www.pksafety.com/">PK Safety</a>), who, like <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5707274949492736">BoscoBob</a> before her, knows way more about fixing my problems than I do.</p>
<p>Nancy was kind enough to give me step-by-step directions on how to apply a sturdy smattering of fiberglass mat/resin to the tragically maligned hole, directions she curated and perfected from her experience fixing/consistently-being-in-close-proximity-to boats. "If this treatment is good enough for boats, which have to withstand waves and constant interaction with salt water," I thought to myself in a conveniently blog post-ready format, "it's sure as hell good enough for protecting my truck from a few gentle raindrops."</p>
<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>As you can see from the picture above, this wasn't a small undertaking. Quite the opposite, this was hands down the largest <del>truck improvement</del> project I've attempted thus far. And as a person who's never considered themselves "handy", "useful with tools", "remotely adroit at anything that requires common sense", or "likely to survive attempted usage of industrial chemicals", this was sure to be a demanding (and educational) experience. With Nancy's instructions in hand, I biked off to, you guessed it, <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5649050225344512">Home Depot</a>, a company so integral to my truckly lifestyle that I should probably double down and <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5669283816275968">buy stock</a> in it. On my short list of things to buy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acetone.</strong> As it turns out, acetone is useful for more than just pyromaniac teenagers (guilty) and removing nail polish. It does a solid job of cleaning/preparing surfaces before putting other chemicals on them. It was especially useful for my needs because there were clearly failed attempts by previous owners to fix The Hole, as was evident from the strange rubbery white residue surrounding it, which I'm guessing is <a href="https://www.getflexseal.com/">Flex Seal</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Face masks.</strong> Preferably get the type that save you from losing a couple IQ points to the chemical cocktail you're about to whip up.</li>
<li><strong>Drop Cloth.</strong> Because I've never been particularly capable of coloring inside the lines, and I don't have a burning desire to cover my walls and floor in a nearly-impossible-to-remove epoxy.</li>
<li><strong>Great Stuff&#174; - Window &amp; Door Sealant.</strong> To completely misuse and make the walls look like they're giving birth to some cross between <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">Alien</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_Puft_Marshmallow_Man">Stay Puft</a> dude. Check out the picture below to see just how I thoroughly I screwed up. Note: It is literally called Great Stuff&#174;, my opinion isn't <em>quite</em> as enthusiastic.</li>
<li><strong>Fiberglass resin.</strong> To go with the Fiberglass hardener.</li>
<li><strong>Fiberglass hardener.</strong> To go with the Fiberglass resin.</li>
<li><strong>Fiberglass cloth.</strong> If the resin and hardener are the marshmallows and chocolate in a bad food analogy, the cloth is the graham crackers that hold the whole sticky metaphoric S'more situation together.</li>
<li><strong>Painter's tape.</strong> I think the intended purpose is to mark off the area you're working on, but I completely skipped that step.</li>
<li><strong>Empty, clean Chobani&#174; Greek yogurt cups.</strong> For mixing epoxy. I used the low fat plain-flavored variety, but I've heard that strawberry works well too.</li>
<li><strong>Paint brushes.</strong> For gooping up and dabbing the epoxy onto the fiberglass cloth.</li>
<li><strong>Several types of gloves.</strong> Because while <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5730192894984192">super-gluing your fingers together</a> is undoubtedly unpleasant, I imagine epoxying your fingers together is at least two circles of Hell deeper.</li>
<li><strong>Water.</strong> Stay hydrated out there, kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nancy's list of Hole-fixing ingredients also included things like "sand paper" and "primer" and "rollers", which I dutifully ignored because it looked like their collective purpose was to make everything look prim and proper, which isn't of any particular interest to the dude who lives in a borderline leprotic van still covered in several-year-old graffiti.</p>
<h2>Getting It Done</h2>
<p>I had everything I needed to do this thing, I just had to put the rubber to the (literal?) road. I woke up early on a beautiful and crisp Saturday morning, drove to a nice remote area, and threw open the back gate, both for ventilation and sunlight. 
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9RarLc73ytsZ49vq46lRu0SR9REJ9mPuVSks1VxWTUpNm8P6djCyqAs7exslfnEdf7anLw9rrNlEW4pyYDZYqbpy9v33SL4yNMaUCg=s500"/>
<p>The view from my work site.</p>
</div>
<p>The first step was to survey the area and plan out how I was going to handle it. There was a chunk of fiberglass missing on the right edge, and there were a bunch of cracks that extended about a foot beyond that. I had bought more than enough to do the whole area over, so I put some acetone on a paper towel and cleaned down everything extending a few inches beyond the cracks. The idea is that the acetone removes anything that would prevent a good bond from forming.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1fHkA_48SMN8mu201nPHlNf5xSXQFsXsbsWvWMb3rwgSvaITlearkMgleJ4PLaOPjeo0u2RRjg8p2InFD83Bw3s2mK8nDFADfI_T=s500"/>
<p>Yup, definitely a hole.</p>
</div>
<p>One last piece of setup: I tossed the disposable drop cloth out below the soon-to-be affected area, and taped it to the wall with the painter's tape. Before whipping out the rest of my meth lab essentials, I threw on a pair of gloves and one of the face masks.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9TTun575AZfO_QYkaK4uVOnSbUWaYhYIjgW4pWglUViFswFRgy969azNkJmkqmrNcf0GayY0P8rcKrkwL8RYrmUPlwO3--Yulz-Esg=s400"/>
<p>Casting sideward glances to intimidate and confuse The Hole is also a recommended, but optional, step. *insert a good <a href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99801/2132844-darkknightrises20111201.jpg">Bane</a> impression here*</p>
</div>
<p>Anything more than very basic instructions leave me befuddled and deterred, so I was grateful that the fiberglass resin and hardener had simple ratios to mix together: a certain number of drops of hardener per cup of resin. The trick is that you only have 10-15 minutes of time to spread the mixture once you mix them, then they harden up and become a sad unusable cement. That's why I had been binging on  Chobanis&#174;, I needed multiple cups for multiple small batches. So I poured a small quantity of the molasses-like resin into my plastic measuring cup, and then counted out the corresponding number of hardener drops into one of my re-purposed yogurt cups. After pouring the two components into the same container, I frantically looked around for the stirring sticks I had completely forgotten to purchase. Luckily, the wood chips on the ground just outside the truck made for great improvised stirring sticks. From there, it was just a matter of painting a thin layer of epoxy, ripping a piece of fiberglass cloth off, dabbing it all down with a little more epoxy, and then repeating the whole process again, layer after layer. I put down around 20 pieces of the fiberglass cloth in total over the course of my three batches of epoxy, with each piece roughly half the size of a sheet of paper.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZdNrsbl0h2Fs9WpSlhcXLKEiMhl4QtEeHJtHy4pyIkqf4_XuC92u4-yvhbXH3iueC7hOP3lWZHHleguLtCYnznjye3S-RGsI0oL-=s500"/>
<p>The end result (before drying). It doesn't actually look any better in this picture, but I can assure you that it's all one solid piece now.</p>
</div>
<p>To finish up, I threw all the leftover, unsalvageable, half-used ingredients onto the drop cloth, which I then rolled into a little ball and tossed into a giant garbage container belonging to a nearby construction site. I then left the truck-patch to cure (and vent some of the brain-cell-killing chemicals away) for the rest of the day, opting to go on a nice long bike ride and coding from a cafe a few towns over.</p>
<h2>Is It Holding Up?</h2>
<p>If you go back and look at my first two <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5685265389584384">Home</a> <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5757334940811264">Improvement</a> projects, you'll see that I did a terrifically shoddy job on them and had to immediately turn around and <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=6303981198376960">repair</a> them. Luckily, that doesn't seem to be the case this time around. Nancy's instructions worked wonderfully, and the bond still appears sturdy as ever. One pretty big issue is that I didn't totally fix my leaking problem. I still have a pretty consistent drip from the metal area to the top right of where The Hole was, and I have to do a bit more research as to where it's coming from before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o">El Ni&#241;o</a> turns my truck terrarium into an aquatic abode.</p>
<h2>The Great "Great Stuff&#174;" <strong>Un</strong>provement Project</h2>
<p>The idea behind Great Stuff&#174; is pretty simple. You shake the can, you spray it into the cracks, it expands a bit, and it provides a little extra insulation. I thought this would be a great addition to the area around The (now defunct) Hole, and just the back of the truck in general, which is a bit drafty. But I forgot to take into account how bad my basic motor skills are, and how much the stuff expands, and I kind of just coated seemingly random bits of the truck in it. It legitimately looks like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/">Shrek</a> had a vicious cold and was sneezing huge mucus-y webs of lumpy sadness everywhere.</p>

<p>A collage of my ceaseless stupidity.</p>
</div>
<p>The icing on the cake is that the only way to remove the stuff, per the instructions, is "mechanically". Meaning I have to physically rip this stuff free from everything that I've attached it to if I want to redo it properly, which I'd like to do at some point. Like I said before, if nothing else, this project was very, very educational. And while I don't know when any of this information will ever come in handy again, it's certainly helping me towards (wrongly?) believing I can undertake larger and more ambitious projects in the future and maybe have them not fail entirely/spectacularly. I guess we'll see.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><em>Desiccant</em>.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the way that word sounds. It's like a discount version of <em>decadent</em>, except that it hasn't been soiled by rampant overuse in chocolate commercials. I was curious as to its etymology which, as you'll see above, isn't nearly as exciting as I'd hoped. I had never even heard of the word until a reader, known only to me as "BoscoBob", brought it up in an email.</p>
<h2>Bob</h2>
<p>Let me tell you a little bit about Bob (which he will henceforth be called for brevity), not that I know much about him anyway. Bob also spent quite a bit of time living in a vehicle, five times as much as I have as of this writing in fact. In my eyes, this makes Bob a Wise Truck Elder&#8482;. So when Bob came to me with advice, I took notes. Diligent notes.* His advice was this: it's going to get cold out, and human beings do a lot of breathing and sweating. If you can't control that moisture, every eligible surface in the truck will be covered in mold, which is undoubtedly going to make you an unhappy camper.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, as Bob noted, there exists a magical technology that requires neither fire nor electricity to operate, and yet its mere presence can suck the moisture clear out of the air and trap it within, like a genie in a lamp. Bob was talking about desiccants.</p>
<h2>The Prophecy</h2>
<p>And sure enough, Wise Truck Elder Bob was right. As we creep further and further into Fall, unwaveringly towards Winter, I've found that my mornings are becoming increasingly&#8230;moist. Every non-porous surface: ceilings, walls, and even my phone** and battery pack, are uniformly damp, almost like the morning dew on a grassy field. Except this field is me and everything I own. It's gross to think of it as though everything is coated in my own sweat and breath though, it's more like when your windshield fogs up on a cold day. The air in the truck is warmer (because of me) and more moist (yes, also because of me), and this warm, moist air meets up with the cold metal of the truck and subsequently condenses. I mean I'm not a meteorologist or anything, but that's my understanding of it.</p>
<p>So I did what any self-respecting truck person who doesn't like bathing in their own breath would do, and I went to Home Depot, where they sell industrial-sized tubs of this stuff:</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ha2ppW6qUbbxgu5OU7AJuN9qt4_LsAJks3fTPKvzRKb-148NIOVXnRkF4zTACSAIPaPTpxMebSw6uR37D9LlfOqMd9Rt_s0RMYB6AQ=s400"/>
<p><a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/DampRid-64-oz-Fragrance-Free-High-Capacity-Moisture-Absorber-FG50T/100391308">DampRid&#174;</a>, which I can only assume is concentrated cat litter</p>
</div>
<p>I got a 64 oz tub, which is supposed to be enough for a space far larger than my 128 ft<sup>2</sup> truck, but I like to live by the credo "Better Safe Than Sorry" when it's convenient to me. The process for getting it setup was pretty complicated though, and took longer than I'd have liked. I'll painstakingly detail the steps out here, but be warned, it's a pretty arduous process and I wouldn't recommend someone begins it unless they have a <strong>substantial</strong> amount of time on their hands to see it through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take off the lid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yeah okay I lied, that's all you have to do. Seems suspiciously simple, I know, but it definitely did fulfill its end of the bargain. The area around my bed was much drier the morning after opening it; my phone and battery pack weren't in any danger of short-circuiting either. The tub of <del>re-branded cat litter</del> DampRid&#174; says it'll last six months, which isn't bad at all for a $10 investment. I suspect it'll have a shorter shelf life because the truck isn't an entirely closed system, but I'll need a bit of empirical evidence before I can say for sure. In the mean time, I'll enjoy being left high and dry thanks to the definitely excellent existence of the desiccant.</p>
<p><em><sub>*I didn't actually take any notes. This was an email, after all.</sub></em></p>
<p><em><sub>**My phone is waterproof, so this isn't as concerning as one would thing. Still definitely not ideal though, thus the desiccants.</sub></em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>It's been a while (six months <em>almost</em> to the day) since I did my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5676830073815040">last big Home Improvement post</a>, and I think it's about high time we changed that. Not only because a lack of Home Improvement posts signals stagnancy on the front of truck-progress, but also because there is much to be improved upon truck-wise, and I should be more proactive and motivated to work on it. This, as is likely evident from the title, is just a "Mini" Home Improvement project, but there are two fairly large ones that I've yet to write about, so expect those <del>soon</del> eventually.</p>
<h2>Meeting Michael&#8230;'s</h2>
<p>In a shocking turn of events, a home improvement project didn't land me at Home Depot. Instead, I found myself ambling around the aisles of <a href="http://www.michaels.com/">Michael's</a>, a fairly ubiquitous craft chain store. I'd place Michael's pretty far down on the list of places I'd expect to find myself at, right there with "an apartment showcase", "grad school", and "a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeowner_association">Homeowner's Association</a> meeting". And yet there I was, shopping for <a href="http://www.michaels.com/artminds-leather-wristband-kit-narrow/10185321.html#start=12">leather wristbands</a> and <a href="http://www.michaels.com/gorilla-super-glue/10111196.html#q=gorilla+glue&amp;start=1">Super Glue</a> like a pre-K camp counselor.</p>
<p>This strange shift in shopping proclivities came about as I attempted to solve a problem that has been plaguing me since before I moved in. I detailed it at the end of <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5697982787747840">this</a> post, but as a refresher, my problem was thus: I have a house on wheels that I drive sometimes, how do I properly secure dresser drawers so I'm not launching them (and pretty much everything I own) across the truck every time I take a turn too hard? My initial solution, Velcro, had failed spectacularly (and very audibly from the driver's compartment). As a stopgap solution so that I could, you know, <strong>drive</strong>, I wrapped the corners of the drawers in painter's tape, the only reasonable adhesive I had available. Naturally, this had a few problems of its own, like how it's annoying to un-peel and re-peel tape every time I want to grab a pair of socks, or how the heat during the day means that the tape loses adhesion pretty quickly and I have to reapply it, etc, etc. I got a few suggestions from <del>strangers on the Internet</del> readers on using childproof drawer locks and a few other ideas, but they didn't seem quite robust enough for my use case.</p>
<h2>Leather and Bond<del>age</del>ing Glue</h2>
<p>Eventually (read: two weeks ago), I had a bout of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_inspiration">divine inspiration</a> during which I realized that some combination of buttons and snaps would suit this situation well. The aforementioned trip to Michael's happened, and then I applied the following process to save my dresser drawers from my dubious driving abilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the ineffective Velcro squares from the drawers by wedging your fingernail under them and peeling them off. Make sure to break or otherwise bend at least three fingernails in the process.</li>
<li>Cut the male end off of the leather straps into little squares.</li>
<li>Cut the female end of the strap to 3 (ish) inches.</li>
<li>Measure the vertical midpoint of the drawers and mark them with a pen.</li>
<li>Measure out where the longer straps should be glued down and mark those with a pen too.</li>
<li>Glue those little square suckers down to the rolling-drawer-handle-part with some super glue.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT GLUE YOUR FINGERS TOGETHER.</strong></li>
<li><strong>DON'T GLUE YOUR FINGERS TO THE LEATHER EITHER.</strong></li>
<li>You glued your fingers together, didn't you?</li>
<li>Use the acetone you bought for a different home improvement project to unstick your thoroughly bonded fingers.</li>
<li>Apply glue to the last inch and a half of the longer straps, leaving room so that the snappy end can move around a little bit.</li>
<li>Definitely don't immediately test it out, wait like 8 hours (at least) for the glue to fully cure.</li>
</ol>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JdndRLOD3S2WsPh1id4UUU4vUuyn9n8oVSlYsKLIihCFb9pAQ3YOVayUEsBCtXAnMaoIMv4cPmhQ7ZIraRS0MLMsUTxk3vmmONGgBg=s600"/>
<p>Boom. Successful strappage.</p>
</div>
<h2>How well does it work?</h2>
<p>It works really well&#8230;when I remember to snap them shut. On more than one (read: three) occasions, I totally forgot to snap them into place before driving off, which, as it turns out, makes them Totally Ineffective&#8482;. But when I <em>do</em> remember to use them, they work swimmingly. Super glue fares especially well when the force is parallel to the surface, I just have to be careful to not tear the leather straps off like a Band-Aid&#174; when I unsnap them. Overall, it took about hour to do all the measuring/cutting/gluing, which isn't bad in the slightest, especially when it means driving around is less like throwing my belongings in a tumble dryer.</p>

<h2>Trainspotting<sup><sup><sub><sub><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/">Definitely</a></strong> not the word I'm looking for, but it sounds cool</sub></sub></sup></sup></h2>
<p>I noted <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5639274879778816">early on</a> that I wasn't the only sketchy-looking vehicle on campus. And the longer I've been doing this, the keener my eye has gotten to the subtle, but telltale signs of "unconventional" or otherwise "alternative" living situations: windows tinted a little too deeply, parking just slightly farther away from a building than everyone else, a few scattered blankets on the back seat. It was nothing more than conjecture and supposition until I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5665117697998848">made contact</a> with another truck-person. Even then though, there were seven or eight cars I was seeing all the time, and they certainly kept me wondering.</p>
<p>Beyond campus, I was seeing the same signs everywhere: lines of RVs in loosely-regulated parking areas, disconnected trailers in run-down driveways, condensation on car windows long after it should have burned off, etc. I couldn't tell if they were as common as I perceived, or if my situation had made me unusually sensitive to it. It reminded me of a story recounted by a high school teacher, whereby he fell in love with a girl who drove a green VW bug, and thereafter started seeing those cars everywhere. He called it the "Green <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_buggy">Punch Buggy</a> Effect&#8482;," though it's likely more commonly called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baader-Meinhof_phenomenon">Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon</a>.</p>
<h2>Joining the Cult</h2>
<p>At first it was merely a hunch, yes, but once I started <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5655608640405504">shouting my automobile affinities</a> from the rooftops, it wasn't long before truck tenants, clunker colonists, sedan citizens, buggy boarders, hatchback inhabitants, and pickup people of all types started to come out of the proverbial woodwork. I quickly found myself in the CC field of an email thread with the title <strong>ATTN: Vehicle Dwellers Meetup</strong>, along with no less than fifteen other like-minded individuals. Most of the thread participants were doing some tech- or startup-related work, though I was impressed with just how diverse the group was, and how sane and reasonable everyone seemed. At this point, I really shouldn't be surprised that reasonable people are coming to this dwelling decision, assuming they're going to be crazy is more of a vestigial knee-jerk reaction on my part from before I dove headfirst into all of this (see <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5741031244955648">here</a> for my initial, incorrect preconceptions). With the voluntarily homeless corralled into a digital conclave, we started planning where we could talk about the various intricacies of our day-to-day lives (much like I do here) and show off our setups. Fittingly enough, it was decided that this shindig would take place at Containertopia, a secret and magical place in Oakland filled with shipping containers in various stages of being converted into homes.</p>
<h2>Meeting My Contemporaries</h2>
<p>The meetup took place on a crisp, sunny Saturday afternoon a few weeks ago, and as such I opted to <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5753952654065664">bike</a> to the Oakland meeting place.</p>
<p><em>Woah woah woah, Brandon, why would you bike up there when <strong>the whole point</strong> of going was to show off your truck house thing?</em></p>
<p>Well there's a few reasons actually. Firstly, I'm not under the illusion that my "setup" is anything more than a bed and a dresser shoved into the back of a decrepit moving van, which I (correctly) assumed would be downright embarrassing in the face of the craftier solutions of others. Plus, I've <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5743868070854656">mentioned</a> that driving the truck is a death sentence, so I opted to showcase the entirety of my lavish, expansive living space by taking a few photos instead of spontaneously combusting on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_880">880</a> during an attempted drive. Summarily, the signs seemed to say, or otherwise suggest, that cycling was surely sensical. In a textbook display of character weakness, I dramatically overestimated my own ability to do sustained cardio and ended up arriving at the agreed upon meeting place an hour or so later than planned. A few calls and texts later, I was led through a wrought iron gate and into what can only appropriately be described as a Mecca for tiny houses of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>The idea behind Containertopia is a fairly simple one: You buy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container">shipping container</a> for between $1,000-$2,000 and have it delivered to the place, which is basically a large open warehouse with communal facilities (electricity, water, etc). From there, you pay a (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/san-franciscos-epic-housing-crisis-2015-8">comparatively reasonable</a>) rent, usually temporarily as you hammer, nail, weld, rip apart, and otherwise modify your shipping container to your specifications and desires with the intention of doing <em>something</em> with it.</p>
<p>The place itself felt like a post-apocalyptic construction site&#8230;but I mean that in the most endearing of ways. There was always the distant whirring of heavy machinery as people worked on realizing their dreams, and the cold concrete floors were littered with all imaginable components and contraptions. We were given tours of a few of the containers, which ranged from barren to decked out with windows, carpeting, insulation, and all of the modern amenities you'd expect from a high-class shipping container house. As for the more mobile participants, their housing solutions ranged from standard RVs all the way down to Priuses (<a href="http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota-announces-the-plural-of-prius.htm">Prii?</a>) outfitted with magnetically-secured insulation. We hung around for a few hours talking about the various trends in tiny housing, living in the Bay Area, and our own ideas, inspirations, and future aspirations, then we grabbed a lovely dinner and parted ways.</p>
<p>All in all, the experience was enlightening. Aside from the fact that I'd never before biked anything even remotely close to 50 miles, it's always interesting to talk with other people from a bunch of backgrounds who've all converged on similar solutions, executed in dramatically different ways. And between this new group of non-stationary settlers, and another group of tech-truckers I've become acquainted with at my own place of employment, I have a new-found network of truck friends, which is something I never thought I'd find myself saying.</p>

<p>Still reading? Sweet. While I can't talk about what I work on in my day to day professional life, I can talk about my background and blog-related things, which in my opinion are more interesting. If you want juicy technical details, skip the "Background" section, that's just me reminiscing over a time in my life where I didn't have to come to grips with being an adult and stuff.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On the sidebar, I mention that I'm a "Software Engineer". I capitalize Software and Engineer because it's my Official Title&#8482; and it makes me feel Very Important&#8482;. I didn't always hold this position though, so let's start at the beginning.</p>
<p>For some reason unbeknownst to my current-self, a smaller, younger version of me had it in his silly little head that he wanted to be a lawyer. Maybe it was the allure of bucket-loads of bucks and the promise of putting particularly unpleasant people in prison, I can't say for sure. In any case, I shot down that dream while filling out a health form (or something similar) and realizing that I <em>hated</em> paperwork. Considering being a lawyer is like 99% paperwork (with the other 1% being bureaucracy and more paperwork), I opted for a far less miserable dream.</p>
<p>My first formal introduction to programming was at <a href="https://www.idtech.com/">nerd camp</a> when I was 13. I learned the fundamentals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, building a basic command-line choose-your-own-adventure game. That was cool and all, but it was actually one of the other classes that caught my attention. A different course was using <a href="http://www.clickteam.com/multimedia-fusion-2-developer">Multimedia Fusion</a>, a programming platform with an easy click-and-drag UI. When you're 13 years old and you just made your first text-based game, that feels pretty sweet. When you look over and the kid next to you has made a full-on graphical game complete with sprites and sounds, you know it's time to step up your game.</p>
<p>So after camp was all over and done with, I started experimenting with this Multimedia Fusion software. I eventually got good enough with it to actually work with Clickteam, the company producing the software, and I built some educational children's games to showcase their tools. Multimedia Fusion was really a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_drug_theory">gateway programming language</a> though, and it wasn't long before I started looking elsewhere to get my fix.</p>
<p>I spent five summers in my hometown as a parking lot attendant, and as the beach/lot became more popular over the years, people started asking for a way to make parking reservations online. Being the enterprising 17 year-old that I like to think I was, I whipped up a web app in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a> (for no other reason than I didn't know any better), and an accompanying Android app. This PHP app was hands-down the worst thing I'd ever written in my life. Not only did it have zero testing/version control/productionization/comments/coherence/style of any kind, the codebase was essentially a Franken-program of half-working snippets from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> duct-taped to a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> instance hosted on a now-defunct web host, with all the worst CSS attributes in existence plastered onto the frontend. Somehow it worked though, and every day I'd use the Android app to keep a live-updating count of how many cars were in the lot, and people would pay me a dollar a piece to reserve a spot.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.umass.edu/">college</a>, I did a little bit of everything. I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5752142325350400">drove buses</a>, programmed bus websites, graded for classes, and picked up contracts for any project I could get my hands on. Along the way I dabbled in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>/<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, some Android stuff, a ragtag collection of web frameworks/technologies, and even a bit of assembly. I eventually stumbled upon <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>, and that's what most of the code I write of my own volition ends up being in, including this blog.</p>
<h2>The Blog</h2>
<p>At a high-level: this blog is written in Golang and hosted on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs">Google App Engine</a>. Posts and questions are stored in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/datastore/">Datastore</a>, and images are stored in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/blobstore/">Blobstore</a>. The frontend is your standard  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> stack with a sprinkling of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> because, let's be honest, nobody actually <em>enjoys</em> frontend web dev. I don't use <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> or any other markup languages; posts are written in plain ole HTML, with the odd CSS class added to my stylesheet for new functionality.</p>
<h3>Golang</h3>
<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> before, allow me to make the introduction. It's a fairly simple language, looks like a bastard child of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a>, and puts primitives for concurrency right into the language. It's compiled and garbage-collected, which means deployments come in the form of single solitary binaries, and memory leaks are less likely to exist/ruin your day. If you're familiar with C or Java, you can probably learn the language in an afternoon. Built right into the standard library is a world-class <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/">HTTP package</a>, as well as a templating system, and there's an extensive network of tooling covering everything from linting and formatting to deadlock detection and code coverage.</p>
<h3>App Engine</h3>
<p>App Engine is the magical piece of technology I use to host my code. It's kind of like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, if Heroku didn't hold your hand <em>quite</em> so tightly and was built on <a href="http://genius.com/1501009">big-boy infrastructure</a>. It provides a great local development environment for me to iterate on, and deployments take &lt;30 seconds. The built-in logging, monitoring, profiling, load-balancing, versioning, and auto-scaling, among a dozen other features, mean that I can focus on the blog and not unrelated productionization details.</p>
<h2>Savings Clock</h2>
<p>The code for the <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5764640680181760">savings clock</a> can be found at the bottom of <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/js/main.js">this</a> Javascript file. It's basically just a function that runs once a second and calculates my savings given some hard-coded values and the current date/time. Since my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5743868070854656">insurance</a> rate is variable (as is the cost of rent), I divide the time between May and whenever into "epochs", each of which has a start and an end date, and the insurance and rent prices for those respective time periods. Then I iterate over the epochs, noting whether or not we're in the middle of one, and sum up the savings over all of them. Before updating the display on the page, I check if the value is negative (which it isn't anymore!) and format it appropriately.</p>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>I threw the blog together over the course of a few days in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5629499534213120">May</a>, back when I was still unsure whether or not I could actually live out of a truck. Being the hectic time that it was, my main concern wasn't code quality or adequate testing coverage, but rather getting my thoughts onto the proverbial paper while they were still fresh in my mushy, unreliable mind. This was fine for a while, but I couldn't help but notice that each new feature took longer to integrate, and was more frequently broken than not. I knew it was time for an overhaul.</p>
<h3>The Refactoring</h3>
<p>The scenario is familiar to anyone who's ever done a bad job at maintaining a codebase: editing existing code becomes painful, and adding new features becomes brittle and burdensome, normally involving lots of copy and pasting and manual testing. In my case in particular, there was little to no isolation between components, and I was passing around global objects like it was nobody's business. So I started a new branch (because I use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> like a reasonable human being), and set to work. The first big change I made was wrapping App Engine's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/reference#Context">Context</a> with my own and passing that into all my request handlers. Then I added <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#interfaces_and_types">interfaces</a> for database lookups to decouple the implementation details from the business logic. Wrapping the default <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">templating</a> system with my own helped to get rid of the code duplication surrounding rendering common components, and a bunch of other small code clean up tasks around the site reduced complexity and fragility. Abstracting things like pagination and post creation out into their own independent ideas further slimmed the handler methods. Since everything is easier to test with proper abstraction, I tossed in a few more unit tests for basic functionality, and finished up by running the <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint">golint</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/vet/">go vet</a> tools and implementing the suggestions they provided. A few weeks and a few thousand lines of code later, we're here, with a much more maintainable web app. To celebrate, I started adding a few new features.</p>
<h3>Caching</h3>
<p>When this blog was only getting 10 hits a day, it didn't matter how inefficiently I served up my content. After all, Datastore read/write requests are charged by the millions. I could have ran the website on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and nobody would have been any the wiser. But my fleeting collision with <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5655608640405504">the limelight</a> meant that suddenly those redundant calls started to add up. It wasn't until recently I realized something that should have been abundantly obvious from the outset: I'm the only one who updates the content on the site, I don't need to check the database to see if it's been updated. I can store pretty much everything in memory and serve from there, refreshing the in-memory representations anytime I create or edit a post.</p>
<p><em>Uh Brandon, you know that there's <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> for that sort of thing, right? In fact, it's even integrated into App Engine.</em></p>
<p>I&#8230;I actually didn't know that. And if I <em>had</em> known that earlier, I probably would have done that. But since I had just finished my refactoring, it was a snap to add in a caching interface, and then drop the business logic into my new Context before it delegated calls to the Datastore.</p>
<h3>Parallelism</h3>
<p>A couple days ago, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cloud-trace/">Cloud Trace</a> feature of App Engine. So I turned it on, loaded the main page, and saw the following:

<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gw6UVDSqI0bQOOZXVkUgAdpvbiZMLd5loUoM20UZiskpvjrRJYfbXNM1-HCgrtrocUKpx4yGwohloF7yVk3tyBGr2OuF4RJpQdfz=s600"/>
<p>Well that's no good.</p>
</div>
<p>Can you spot the cardinal sin? I'm using a highly-concurrent programming language, and yet I'm loading all of my image URLs for a given page synchronously. There are five requests, because I put five posts per page and each one has a single title image. So I made a new <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Types">type</a> to represent a list of posts, and then added a prefetch function that would spin up a separate <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">goroutine</a> for each post, and wait until all of them had finished, using a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup">WaitGroup</a>. As you can imagine, it's <em>approximately</em> five times faster now, as shown below.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n3hReUGW2e5hha8etqxi2AhBD8wz_W7zGTIZU5lG9Ggat2qHIqfc5T-3FSy4gjbXu2V9R6uaJ7KetpWcZIkj_xGFvDJv6KB96Qqh=s600"/>
<p>Much better.</p>
</div>
<p>But it turns out I had an even <em>worse</em> offender, the search functionality (which actually works now). A search for a common word, like "the" or "truck" or "deranged" (kidding) would load the <strong>entire</strong> corpus of posts, and all of their images serially, as shown below.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9TNRB1oJ5VsGaZzqmz2-2WX-vKFKW8YQIU0zPpTbh-Acvl62jN2dEHqU3J9CoHHbOfQ61N_8w9_UWpYFhcU5x0WSxsd3_GXBk8E=s600"/>
<p>It's hard to see, but this request took nearly 3 seconds!</p>
</div>
<p>But running our handy-dandy new parallel prefetcher on this made quick work of that.</p>
<div class="inline-image">
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a9K-oE4k-UNRAu7fSrySxkWc62qCFzvpda3Nx7dVdxCsgQ3YJVa1sdluhQmeLXuMfmxM0jPD75-4ARHenVeJwp9wKE3GiQTgeWL_Rw=s600"/>
<p>Down to 700ms.</p>
</div>
<p>Naturally, I'm still at the mercy of the longest-running lookup, plus building up the inverted index, which takes nearly 500 ms (and will grow linearly with the number of posts I write), but it's definitely an improvement.</p>
<h2>New Features?</h2>
<p>Now that I have a lean, reasonably sane codebase, what's next? I have a few ideas.</p>
<h3>Post Comments</h3>
<p>People have their own ideas about my ideas, and sometimes they'd like to share them in a forum visible to the rest of the Internet-connected planet. I'll definitely add these at some point, once I build up sufficient tooling and reasonable spam blocking.</p>
<h3>Microposts</h3>
<p>All of my posts are about the various mundane aspects of my life: whether it's <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5678807906254848" l="">leaky roofs</a>, <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5743868070854656">insurance</a>, <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5753952654065664">bicycles</a>, or the <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5158086071287808">weather</a>, if the topic is boring and has no right being expounded about for paragraphs on end, there's a good change I'll write about it. But some of the prosaic things I want to talk about don't always warrant a whole essay, just a little blurb. What I'm describing is basically Twitter, but as an engineer with no interest in actually using Twitter, it seems reasonable to just whip up my own little system.</p>
<h3>E-mail Subscription</h3>
<p>For people who aren't a fan of RSS, but still want to read about my apathetic adventures.</p>
<h3>Interactive Questions/Comments</h3>
<p>Right now I have a comments/questions section, but it's one-way, so if people have a burning question and don't want to e-mail me or wait for me to do another Q&amp;A, they're currently out of luck. I think it'd be cool if when you ask a question, you could get a link that would act as a private, topical chat and we could reply back and forth on that.</p>
<p>I have a few other features in the pipeline: I'd like to improve my search functionality, and maybe add a post listing by month or topic. I've been adding little features here and there and updating the layout, and if you have any good ideas for new features, I'm all ears.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://1.images.southparkstudios.com/shared/about/show-disclaimer.jpg?quality=0.8">Disclaimer</a>: All salaries and bonuses in this post -- even those based on real paychecks -- are entirely fictional. All financial information is paraphrased.....poorly. The following post was written by a 23-year old man who lives in a truck entirely of his own volition and holds a degree in something wholly-unrelated to both business and finance. As such, its content should not be viewed or seriously considered as advice by anyone.</strong></p>
<p>Now that that's out of the way, let's begin.</p>
<h2>In The Beginning</h2>
<p>There's a laundry list of reasons why I do what I do, but one of my bigger goals was to clear out my (fairly unburdensome) student loan debt quickly, certainly more expediently than the 10-year plan my loan servicer was trying to spoon-feed me (with a healthy $3,000 of interest). And despite spending months planning out the various intricacies of truck-life and trying to anticipate all possible eventualities, I had spent virtually no time formulating a proper financial plan. Sure, I had used some broad hand-wavy gestures coupled with the word "investment" before, but apart from a brief experiment using <a href="https://www.acorns.com/">Acorns</a> in college, I hadn't the faintest idea what I was doing. With my loans dwindling with each incoming paycheck, it's time to seriously evaluate what my long-term goals are, and how I plan to reach them.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This post serves two mostly-orthogonal purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Letting people know what I'm doing with my money.</strong> Hopefully, some of the ideas here (which I've <del>poached</del> aggregated from a variety of sources) will be useful in some shape or form to one or more people in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Forcing my own hand in figuring this stuff out.</strong> I do a lot of rough-estimate, back-of-the-proverbial-envelope-type calculations, but now I have about six months of my own real-life financial data. I know how much money is coming in, and how much is going to the various things that allow me to live a happy, healthy life&#8230;sometimes with less of an emphasis on the "healthy" part.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Brief Preface</h2>
<p>There's this (distinctly American) taboo concerning salary discussion, which I've never quite understood. I mean I get it, capitalism dictates that your sole source of worth in this life comes from how much money you can rake in (and then how grandly you can dish it out). As such, discussing salaries will always be <del>very touchy and emotional</del> a colossal dick-measuring contest. Also, knowing the salaries of your peers would give you leverage when negotiating your own pay (which is why sites like <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm">Glassdoor</a> exist). But that clearly doesn't interest the bottom line of an employer. Since this is a monologue and not a discussion though, we're going to throw the taboo and stigma out the window: it's counterproductive, especially when trying to do some frank, no-frills financial planning. Not that the taboo-ness particularly matters to me, I'm clearly not a staunch defender of social convention anyway.</p>
<h2>The Money</h2>
<p>At work, I mash keys on my keyboard and swivel my mouse around until the pixels on my screen arrange themselves in a pattern that pleases me and those around me (nod to <a href="https://xkcd.com/722/">XKCD</a>). For doing so, I'm compensated by my employer, and this compensation is broken into roughly three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Salary.</strong> My base salary is $105,000.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus.</strong> Once a year, I receive a bonus roughly equal to 15% of my salary (give or take a performance multiplier). 15% of $105,000 is $15,750.</li>
<li><strong>Stock.</strong> Every year, I get a certain number of shares of the company. Because stocks are prone to the whims of a bunch of anxious men in fancy suits, I'm going to take about 10% off of the current value of the stock, which means roughly $40,000 a year in stocks. I know I said we'd be staying away from estimation, but this is one of those inherently nebulous things. If there was <em>anyone</em> who knew where the price of a stock was heading, they'd either be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading">arrested</a>, filthy rich, or some combination of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart">two</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So my total before-tax earnings are (approximately) $105,000 + $15,750 + $40,000 = $160,750.</p>
<h3>Where's The Money Go</h3>
<p>It's clear what money I have coming in, but where is it actually going? The way I see it, there are two categories to explore. There's the money that I'm never formally introduced to, because it's absorbed into a vast web of legislation and tax-advantaged accounts, and then there's the money that lives to see the light of <del>day</del> my checking account.</p>
<h4>Death and Taxes</h4>
<p>Since bonuses and stocks are distributed yearly on their own schedules, the money I get in my paychecks naturally comes from my base salary. So $105,000 divided over 26 pay periods would mean $105,000/26 = $4,038.46 every two weeks. And sure enough, that's the number I see at the <em>beginning</em> of my paycheck. From there, we have two types of deductions: Death and Taxes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death.</strong> This portion consists of my <a href="http://www.financereference.com/learn/401k-plan">401k</a> contribution ($1,200), my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account">HSA</a> contribution ($293.75), and my downright ruthless dental and vision insurance ($3.57). These things go under the "Death" portion because they're health-related and I can't access any of that money (without penalty) until I'm 59.5/65 (as of the present day's legislation for the 401k and HSA respectively). And who knows what I'll be like when I'm 60 (assuming a truck-related incident doesn't take me out of the game before then)? I can only assume I'll be dead inside, hollowed out from years of engaging in such soul-sucking adult activities as sitting in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5651442522128384">traffic</a> and having mindless conversations about the weather.</li>
<li><strong>Taxes.</strong> This portion consists of the money I distribute among various government cubicles: a Disability Tax ($36.31), State Income Tax ($164.34), Medicare ($54.34), Federal Income Tax ($412.93), and Social Security Tax ($232.33). I've capitalized all of these terms because they sound Very Important&#8482;.</li>
</ul>
<p>After both Death and Taxes, my biweekly take-home pay is $4,038.46 - ($1,200 + $293.75 + $3.57) - ($36.31 + $164.34 + $54.34 + $412.93 + $232.33) = $1,640.89.</p>
<p><em>Woah woah Brandon, hold on for a second. The yearly contribution limit for a 401k is $18,000, and $3,350 for a personal HSA. Crunching the numbers, your paycheck contributions are way too high!!</em></p>
<p>You'd normally be correct, over-eager eagle-eyed finance-savvy reader. The discrepancy is that I started working in May. I didn't start contributing to the 401k until June, and I didn't get my act together and start dumping small fistfuls of money into the HSA until September. The great thing about this is that starting at the beginning of next year, these two contributions are going to drop pretty dramatically (because they're spread over a full year), adding about $900 to my bi-weekly bottom line.</p>
<h4>The Leftovers</h4>
<p>We've established that 60% of my salary is gone before I see a cent of it (which is fine for reasons we'll get to soon), where does the rest of it go? If I were living in an apartment and paying the rate of $2,180 I estimated <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5764640680181760">here</a>, &gt;65% of <em>my after-tax money</em> would go to that. But that, as we're all well-aware at this point, is not the case. So where <em>is</em> that money going? I was actually kind of curious myself, so I opened up my various credit card/bank statements and have itemized everything that cost more than $100 and was purchased on or after May 26th.</p>

<p>That accounts for most, if not all, of the big things, but naturally there are hundreds of smaller purchases that paint the picture more vividly: the (slightly) more reasonably-priced meals out, the movie tickets, the too-frequent Starbucks visits, the weekly Home Depot trips, etc. It'd be silly to have gathered all this information if we weren't going to draw some meaningful conclusions from it though. One thing I noticed is, though I haven't included the dates for the expenses, most of my earlier expenditures can be characterized by one mindset, while the later ones subscribe to a different school of thought. When I first adopted the truck life, my financial thinking was along the lines of, "I don't have to pay rent, that's ~$2,000 a month I can blow on whatever I want!" That mindset, as I'm slowly figuring out, is the wrong one to have. The new mindset is, "Consumption alone doesn't make happiness. Find what <em>really</em> brings you happiness, and invest your resources into that." I know, I know, I sound like a damn fortune cookie, but let me explain how that maps to my real-life plans.</p>
<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>Like I said at the beginning of this post, I didn't really know what I wanted aside from freedom from debt. It wasn't until the Internet <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5655608640405504">became privy</a> to my life and started feeding me new perspectives and resources that it really clicked: I'm in the perfect position to retire early, and it aligns precisely with my goals. The more I thought about it, the less I could believe I hadn't seen it earlier. My motivation for all of this had always been "to travel the world", but what I didn't realize was how that was only a small piece of the bigger picture.</p>
<h3>Making it a Reality</h3>
<p>It's easy to say, "I want to retire early". But we all know talk is cheap, so let's start acting. More than a few people had pointed me towards <a href="http://forum.earlyretirementextreme.com/viewtopic.php?t=6977">Early Retirement Extreme</a>, <a href="http://www.madfientist.com/">Mad Fientist</a>, and <a href="http://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/mustachianism-around-the-web/this-google-employee-has-his-mustache-on-lock!/">Mr. Money Mustache</a>, none of which I had ever heard of before. Mr. Money Mustache (MMM), in particular, has tons of ideas and philosophies that I'd been applying to my own life totally independently. His concept of <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/06/meet-mr-money-mustache/">"Mustachianism"</a> centers on <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5657382461898752">how to think about happiness</a>, <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5724160613416960">conscientious consumption</a>, and <a href="frominsidethebox.com">life-hacks to cut unnecessary expenses</a>, which normally circles around to his love of <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5636470266134528">bikes</a>. One thing that MMM had that I did not (aside from 20 years of extra life-experience) was a solid investment plan.</p>
<h4>Investment</h4>
<p>How early you can retire correlates with <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/">how much of your money you save</a>. When you save money such that you can live on <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/">~4%</a> of the principal balance a year, you can retire. And by "save money", I mean take it and invest it in things that appreciate in value by, on average, &gt;7% a year. This is something that was missing from my original plan, because I had banked (no pun intended) on maxing out my 401k for the next 35 years and then retiring on that money. Getting started with this huge shift in plans was surprisingly easy. My company uses <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com">Vanguard</a> to manage our 401k accounts, so it was dangerously easy for me to open up a personal investment account through them and throw some money in there.</p>
<p><em>But Brandon, you know nothing about investing, how could you possibly have made a reasonable, balanced portfolio?</em></p>
<p>Because <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/index-funds">index funds</a> are magical. I have no interest in buying individual stocks, I'm no Warren Buffett. I want something that averages out the market, smoothing over dips in different sectors and provides fairly consistent returns over long periods of time. But which index fund do I pick? I have no opinions on what direction the dividend market is heading (price-earnings ratios and their meaning are complete voodoo witchcraft to me), so I didn't put any particular emphasis on whether or not the index included dividend-paying companies. I didn't want to get too fancy with international companies, that's another area where I'm not nearly well-versed enough to make reasonable, informed decisions. I also knew that I wanted something with a low-expense ratio, so that my returns actually make it back to me and not to some hotshot banker putting a down payment on his third Lambo. All of these things led me to <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0968&amp;FundIntExt=INT">VOO - Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF</a>, an index fund from Vanguard that tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. It has a super low expense ratio (0.05%), and there's nothing too crazy or exotic about it. So I took $1,000 that I was going to use to pay down my loans, and I used it to buy a few shares of VOO.</p>
<p><em>But Brandon, I thought the goal was to pay down your student loans quickly so they don't accumulate interest?</em></p>
<p>That was (and still is) the goal, but there are a couple things to consider. First, I've paid off all of the higher interest (6.8%) student loans I had, the remaining loans all have a (dirt-cheap) 3.4% interest rate. And though past performance is not an indicator of future results, VOO has had annual returns of &gt;10%. Even accounting for inflation, throwing my money at VOO and letting my loans accumulate interest is likely a profitable plan. That said, it's hard to put a value on the peace of mind you get from being debt-free, so my plan going forward is to split my savings-money between investing and loans, with about a 60/40 split leaning towards Vanguard. Once I get my bonus in a few months, I'll likely use that to put the final nail in the coffin of my short-lived student loan debt.</p>
<p><em>But Brandon, if you plan to retire so early, why bother with your HSA and 401k at all? It's not like you can use that money.</em></p>
<p>Good question, straw man alter ego. There are a couple perfectly valid reasons, but the biggest one is free money. My company matches 50% of my 401k contribution up to the $18,000 limit, meaning they hand me $9,000 a year extra just because I'm looking out for future me. Similarly, they drop $1,000 into the HSA every year as part of my health insurance plan. Another good reason is that I'm putting <em>before tax</em> money into these accounts, so they decrease my tax burden as well. On top of that, I learned that I can invest my HSA money, effectively turning it into a second retirement fund. One of the options for HSA investing was <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0854&amp;FundIntExt=INT">VIIIX</a>, which is basically the same thing as VOO above, just in a different type of account. All of this means that even when I retire early, both of these funds will continue to (hopefully) earn money and compound, and I get magical cash windfalls for my 60th and 65th birthdays. Plus, with a trick I learned about <a href="http://www.madfientist.com/hsa/">here</a>, you can actually take tax-free money out of your HSA before 65.</p>
<h4>Lifestyle and Looking Forward</h4>
<p>I'm already on track to make this a reality, and retire at 30 (or earlier, who knows), but going into it with the right mindset will make it even easier. I've been on my soapbox talking about how true happiness, for most people, isn't hiding in shopping malls or the crevices between the fresh leather seats of a new car, but I haven't been living my own credo to the fullest. Looking back at the past six months and my expense list above, I had more than my fair share of expensive nights out that only served to fatten me up and slim my wallet, leaving me with a few fuzzy memories and a productivity-ruining hangover. I get so much more lasting happiness from taking quiet bike rides down the Bay Trail, or even just sweeping out the truck on a lazy Sunday morning, opening the back gate to let the sunshine in and the gentle breeze twirl my dust pile around. It's just a matter of training myself to look in the right places.</p>
<p>As for my actual "early retirement", I probably shouldn't even call it that. When I say "early retirement", I really just mean the freedom to do what I want, and not have to work to survive. It's very unlikely that I'd actually stop working; I have sketches for grand plans that involve spending months on beaches in southeast Asia coding up whatever projects cross my mind. The only tricky thing for me now is figuring out how much money I'd need to retire on. My current life is heavily subsidised by my employer, and retiring would necessarily take that away from me. Luckily, I have a few years to figure it all out. For now, I'm just going to enjoy the interesting technical challenges I'm presented with on a daily basis, and watch my future unfold.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><em>Note: I've never seen Game of Thrones, but I'm pretty sure the title is a reference to it.</em></p>
<p>When I was a kid, I used to watch my dad plow driveways and parking lots. He'd be out in the middle of a blizzard, wearing a sweatshirt (at most), carving out huge scoops of snow and heaving them over his shoulder. In moments like those, I thought he was a true-to-life superhero. So naturally it's no shock that I inherited his lust for needless feats of masculinity and macho-ness. As fall turned to winter every year, I'd resist transitioning to a more climate-conscious wardrobe, clinging on to my T-shirts and basketball shorts until it was <del>borderline</del> painful. I chose to "brave" <a href="http://weather-warehouse.com/WeatherHistory/PastWeatherData_BostonLoganIntLArpt_Boston_MA_January.html">some of the coldest, snowiest winters in Boston history</a> wearing only a UMass hoodie and some well-worn jeans. And even when I wasn't being unnecessarily obstinate,  I still spent four years with a roommate who loved keeping the windows open on frosty nights, and that's <em>basically</em> like sleeping outside, right? I'm well-aware that these weren't the smartest decisions, but there is an upshot: I was, without realizing it, conditioning myself for my current situation.</p>
<h2>The Realization</h2>
<p>As we creep closer and closer to winter, I've been noticing my reluctance to leave the warm embrace of my bed for the frigid world beyond.* Luckily, this is more my own hypochondria than actual hypothermia. After all, how bad can it really be when the <strong>record</strong> low for the area <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco#Climate">barely breaks freezing</a>?  Remembering the bitter -17&#176; F morning I experienced last semester in Amherst, where I could literally feel my nose hairs stick together with each breath, the current climate is a comparative cakewalk. That said, there is still a big difference between it being 45&#176; outside versus 45&#176; in your home, where you sleep. So what am I to do about it?</p>
<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>The name of the game is heat control. When you step back and take a good look at the situation, a couple simple facts are pretty clear:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The truck is not insulated.**</strong> The only thing separating me from the outside world is thin sheathing, made out of a material that transmits energy (or a lack thereof) very well.</li>
<li><strong>There is only one source of heat in the truck.</strong> As it turns out, it's my own body ripping apart the quinoa and chicken I had for dinner so it can maintain homeostasis.</li>
<li><strong>I can only perceive the temperatures around me.</strong> As a human being consisting of nerves packed into a tangible, physical form, I can't sense anything beyond my own body.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Brandon, are you high? Don't get all existential/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_projection">Astral projection-eqsue</a> on me, what's with that last bullet point?</em></p>
<p>Don't worry, we're getting there. Now that we've established our few basic truths, we can come to a nice logical conclusion. Since the truck is so poorly-insulated, attempts to keep it warm are going to be futile and wasteful. So really, what I have to do is make sure that the sweet, sweet heat I'm producing doesn't go far. And that's exactly what I've been doing. I picked up a bulky, patchy jacket from <a href="http://www.goodwill.org/">Goodwill</a>, a <a href="http://www.kohls.com/product/prd-1832291/champion-retro-jogger-pants-men.jsp?color=Granite%20Heather">pair of cozy sweatpants</a>, and an extra blanket (all pictured above). That way, as my body works off the extra plate of fish tacos I opted for, I'm taking that heat and making a comfortable little cocoon out of it. I can't help but be reminded of a piece of my father's advice, uttered while expressing his relationship with the cold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can always put more layers on, you can only take so many off.</p>
<p>-<em>My Father</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Testing It Out</h2>
<p>It's been cold enough at night for a few weeks now to warrant putting this plan into action. Each night, after I've finished unpacking and repacking my gym bag, I throw on tomorrow's workout rags, then toss on the sweatpants and sweatshirt, and top it off with a jacket. I also throw on socks for good measure, which I've found make a pretty big difference in my eagerness to get out of bed in the morning. I then waddle into my bed like the Eskimo that I am, pull the respective sweatshirt and jacket hoods up, and proceed to sleep like a small child for the ensuing 7-9 hours. As for the effectiveness, I've noticed it doesn't take a ton of mental self-coaxing to get myself out of bed anymore, even when the temperature dips below 40. In fact, I'm sleeping better than ever, though I still need a little <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5733935958982656">more data</a> before I'm ready to do a full-scale analysis.</p>
<h2>Isn't That Bad For You?</h2>
<p>During my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5655608640405504">fifteen minutes of fame</a>, I received many a comment letting me know that exposure to the cold causes any and all of the following ailments: pneumonia, herpes, polio, fetal alcohol syndrome, irritable bowels, death, being placed on Santa's naughty list, etc. Though these claims were dubious at best, I certainly was curious as to what I'm doing to my body. Thusly, I did some research. And when I say "research", I really mean "Googling a phrase aligning with my preconceptions, then reading the most reputable link". As far as my "research" shows, cold weather being the cause of sickness is a <a href="http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/features/cold-and-flu-iq">total myth</a>. From the linked article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Cold weather also does not cause colds -- at least not directly. Despite its name, the common cold is not caused by cold. "It doesn't have any effect at all," says Tallman. "There's no correlation." In fact, you may be more likely to "catch your death of cold" indoors, where it's warm and crowded than outdoors in the chilly air.
</p>
<p>-<em>Matt McMillen, WebMD</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They go on to explain that cold air causes people to be in closer quarters, which in turn causes less-restricted spreading of illnesses. As long as I'm sleeping alone in the truck, which is usually the case, the cold air doesn't appear to be any worse for me. In fact, sleeping in cold weather can <a href="http://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/cool-temperature-alters-human-fat-metabolism">increase your brown fat stores</a> while you sleep, which actually burn calories in colder temperatures. So not only does living in a truck-shaped freezer not hurt my health, it actually boosts my metabolism and makes me even warmer over time. Plus, a combination of reasonable genetics, proper diet, and exercise has graced me with a formidable immune system that drops its guard less than once a year. All things considered, I think I'm in good shape for the winter. The worst case scenario I can see is that it's colder than I'm expecting. If that's the case, I'll follow dear old Dad's advice and get some more jackets, or maybe even spring for a sleeping bag. Bring it on.</p>
<p><sub>*As a rough estimate, I spend about 3 minutes longer in bed for every degree (Fahrenheit) below 50&#176;.</sub></p>
<p><sub>**And I have no intention of insulating it, though weatherproofing is a different story.</sub></p>

<em>Source: <span>My <del>new</del> used, person-powered transportation machine</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I'd like to start with a eulogy.</p>
<p><em>We're gathered here today to mourn the loss of a close friend. His duration in our lives was swift and fleeting, almost ephemeral. His presence was electric, his absence left a hole in my heart, not to mention a deficit in my transportation abilities. Yes, I'm talking about the passing of our beloved friend, my corporate Specialized Turbo.</em></p>
<p>Before I say anything else, let me just acknowledge that this was entirely my fault. Okay, so remember that <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5636470266134528">awesome electric bike</a> I got through a company pilot program? It turns out that a big stipulation of the program is that the <strong>main</strong> usage of the bike has to be commuting. Naturally, living on campus, my "commute" doesn't quite qualify, and so I, with a heavy heart, had to return the bike. In my defense, I <em>was</em> "commuting" to my mailbox (~10 miles away) 3-4 times a week, but that's still not quite in the spirit of the program.</p>
<h2>What Now?</h2>
<p>I was just starting to explore the immense mobility the bike provided me. It liberated me from two equally-unpleasant travelling options: spend all my time walking or drive my clunky, inefficient <strong>house</strong> (it's <em>barely</em> a car, as far as I'm concerned) around. I had bought a <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/826838/giro-savant-bike-helmet">really nice helmet</a> for use with the electric bike, which I'd hate to see sitting around the truck, going to waste. I knew I couldn't go back to my old life Before Cycling (BC for short). I <em>also</em> knew I wasn't going to spend $3,000+ on a fancy, brand new electric bicycle. My current priorities dictate that I split that money between my remaining student loans and my fancy new investment portfolio (to be detailed in a future post). So I started looking around for gently-worn, non-electric road bikes.</p>
<h2>The Haggle Battle</h2>
<p>I was raised Jewish, though I haven't regularly attended services in nearly a decade. It follows that, if you believe in stereotypes, I <em>should</em> theoretically be good at haggling. But experience has shown that I'm just not good at it. In fact, I'd go as far as saying I'm flat out bad at it, somehow forking over more cash than if I had said nothing at all.</p>
<p><em>But Brandon, what does your inconsistent, lackadaisical approach to Judaism have to do with bicycles?</em></p>
<p>Well impatient reader, allow me to explain. On this past Monday evening, I sauntered into a <a href="http://cardinalbikes.com/">quaint used bike shop</a> in Palo Alto, and casually laid down my demand.</p>
<p>"I'm looking for a used road bike", I said, "Nothing fancy, just to get around town. My budget is $300." Notice that I didn't say "<em>about</em> $300" or "<em>around</em> $300". This is important because 1) I'm usually a huge, subconscious advocate for that type of imprecise language and 2) it sets the groundwork for what took place next.</p>
<p>The bike shop salesperson grabs two bikes for me to try out outside. The first one is a "vintage" bike, which is just bike-speak for "really old". I get on it and it starts to spasmodically shift gears without any input from me. Assuming demonic possession, I bring that bike inside and grab the next one. This one doesn't appear to need an exorcism, but I'm not particularly wowed either. It's a bit rusty, and I feel like I'm putting in a disproportionate amount of effort for the snails' pace that I'm moving at. Those bikes were $250 and $300 respectively. I go back inside, and the salesperson says to me, "Here, try this one out, I think you might like it." It feels like <a href="https://youtu.be/5whe9XtdQgw?t=2m">that scene in Harry Potter where he's picking out his first wand and he finds the perfect match in the pair wand to Voldemort's</a>. I get on and it just feels right. Taking it out for a spin, it's smooth and the gears shift nicely. This is the one, I know it. I bring it back inside, the smile on my face lets the salesperson know I've found my bike.</p>
<p>"This one", he says, "is $400."</p>
<p>My heart sinks a bit: though my $300 limit was arbitrary, he doesn't know that, and I intend to stick with it. I let out a sigh, "that's really unfortunate. I like the bike, but $300 is my limit here."</p>
<p>He furrows his brow a bit, "I can probably do $350".</p>
<p>At this point, I realize that my first successful haggle is underway, and I stand firm, "Sorry man, I set aside $300 to get a bike, I really can't go over that." Sure it's not entirely truthful, but $300 <em>is</em> my target.</p>
<p>"It's only a year old and was hardly used. If it were brand new, this bike would cost&#8230;", he pauses for a second to look it up, "over $500. The <strong>best</strong> I can do is $320." It's pretty close to what I wanted and he seems serious, I should take it. It's a great bike and my past day's research says this is a good deal. But I keep pushing.</p>
<p>"That's too bad, I was hoping to take this bike home today. Do you have any other bikes in my price range I could look at?"</p>
<p>He cracks. "You know what, I'll give it to ya for $300".</p>
<p>I take him up on the offer immediately, and I buy a $50 lock too, because I feel bad for subjecting him to my games and appreciate his flexibility. I also genuinely needed a lock. He throws in a kickstand, and attaches the bike lock for me as well. The total, with tax, comes to ~$390. Not bad, not bad at all.</p>
<p>I load it into the back of the truck, and secure it to the <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5735735550279680">bike rack</a> I had built for the electric bike. Because this bike is so much lighter (20 pounds versus 50 pounds), it feels much more stable.</p>
<h2>Quality Time with the Bike</h2>
<p>Hagglefest 2015 was last Monday, so I've had almost a week to get familiar with my new fat-powered race car. I didn't do much riding until yesterday, mostly just short trips into town, which the bike complied with handily, without question. Yesterday however, I did something crazy.</p>
<h3>The Big Ride</h3>
<p>My cardio is generally awful, as I've mentioned before. Jogging a mile requires an act of divine intervention, and I've never cycled more than ~20 miles at once. Even when I did, those 20 mile trips were on the electric bike which, on "full power" mode (the default setting), does most of the work for me. But I'd really been enjoying the bike so far, and I was itching to take it on a <em>real</em> ride. It just so happened that there was a truck-people meetup happening in Oakland on Saturday (which will <em>definitely</em> get its own post). So I resolved to bike to Oakland, a ~50 mile, four hour odyssey from where my box-truck home is parked. I had no idea what I was getting into.</p>
<p>This post is already getting pretty long, so I'll skip most of the tiny, inconsequential details that I love to ramble on about (like how I still had two hours to go when I thought I was "almost there"). The gist is that the ride was punishing, but beautiful. I rode across long swaths of the <a href="http://baytrail.org/">Bay Trail</a>, crossed over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbarton_Bridge_(California)">Dumbarton Bridge</a>, and saw plenty of gorgeous, sprawling land and seascapes. It was well-worth the chapped lips, sweat-soaked clothing, and sore, bruised butt bones (which I now know are called <em>ischial tuberosities</em>). Plus, it's gratifying to know that I biked a distance that's likely distinguishable from space. I still can't feel my legs, but that'll probably get better (right?). I'll definitely do similar rides in the future, once my body forgives me.</p>
<p>One last note that I thought was interesting: If I had still had the electric bike, it's very likely I wouldn't have biked the distance. The battery range is only 25-30 miles, so 60% of the way through my trip, the bike would have died and I'd be left with a 50 pound bike and 20+ miles to go. Not ideal. I would have had to either drive (environmental homicide/generally awful) or <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">Caltrain</a>/<a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> (lame and inconvenient). So I'm actually getting more use out of a less-fancy bicycle. Life is all about your willingness to make lemonade.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><em>Insurance.</em></p>
<p>I've ducked and dodged dependence on electricity and other utilities, and I <em>definitely</em> don't have a home phone or Internet service. Insurance is the one recurring truck-related expense I'm stuck with.* Given how little I drive the truck and my squeaky-clean, accident-free track-record, I would totally ditch that too if it weren't <a href="http://www.dmv.org/ca-california/car-insurance.php">mandatory in California.</a>** And while I may have <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5172785596858368">dodged a bullet</a> with the license situation, that frosty Boston speeding ticket was still looming overhead. So naturally I wasn't ecstatic when I got a letter stating it's time to renew my insurance policy, until I took a good look at my old policy.</p>
<h2>Some Backstory: May 20<sup>th</sup>, 2015</h2>
<p>This was the day I drove my current home off the lot. I was pretty anxious during the purchase, I've never before had to put on a pokerface that says, "Trust me, it's normal that a 22-year old guy is independently buying this decommissioned Budget truck, and I <em>definitely, definitely</em> have no intention of living in it." By hour 4 of negotiating and signing papers, I was itching to leave. To speed up the process, I pretty much accepted all of the defaults for the insurance policy with very little resistance. One of the things I didn't check carefully enough was the "Current Estimated Annual Miles" section, and here's where the fun begins.</p>
<p>The  "Current Estimated Annual Miles" field on my insurance policy was entered as 8,000 miles, which I couldn't help but laugh at. I know some of my decisions could be considered questionable, but the idea of driving that rusty, screaming metal death trap for 8,000 miles a year is downright suicidal. It's already been around the block over 158,000 times (assuming "the block" has a circumference of one mile), driving it any more than I need to is like poking an unstable, already-ticking time-bomb. As with all vehicles that are quite literally powered by explosions, it's not a matter of <em>if</em> it'll break down, but <em>when</em> it'll break down. And who knows how catastrophic the breakage will be? Maybe I'll be lucky enough to experience a simple tire blowout or a quaint engine fire, but what if the back gate just falls off and strews my few possessions all over the road for terrified commuters to run over? I'm not trying to re-create a scene from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Destination">Final Destination</a>, so I drive only when totally necessary. Plus, you can practically hear the screams of future generations coming out of the exhaust pipe as I idle in traffic, getting 8 miles per gallon while I star in Al Gore's nightmares. An estimate of 8,000 miles a year was clearly too high, but how much had I actually driven in the past six months of owning this thing?</p>
<p>Digging out the paperwork from when I bought the truck, I could see that the odometer reading was 157,500 miles at the time of purchase. Taking a quick look at the dashboard on my way out this morning, I saw that I was sitting at a cool 158,514 miles. Putting my engineering degree to work here: 158,514 - 157,500 = 1,014 miles. That's for six months though, so my yearly mileage estimate is ~2,000 miles, give or take a trip to San Francisco. But that's pretty good! Certainly better than the 8,000 estimated miles I'm currently paying for. And fewer miles means less driving, which means spending less time on the road, which (hopefully) means fewer accidents, which (hopefully) means lower insurance premiums! After a (surprisingly quick) call to my insurance agent, I found out that I could bring in the truck, show them the odometer and truck-sale-paperwork, and get an updated quote on my renewal. Sounded good to me</p>
<h2>The Trip</h2>
<p>We've talked about how traffic is everything bad about the world, <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5651442522128384">right</a>? Like, how cars idling on a long stretch of highway are the physical manifestation of <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5692201761767424">evil</a>?  Well I let out my dark side today by leaving work at the height of rush hour and sitting idly on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_101_in_California">101</a>, which I would classify as a Bad Move&#8482;. Instead of a reasonable 15 minutes, which is what the drive would normally have taken, I had 55 glorious minutes to lament over what a terrible invention the automobile is while repeatedly bashing my head against the steering wheel to pass the time. Seriously, I don't understand how people can commute like that every day and still claim to have a soul. Anyway, I eventually arrived at the insurance place, where they took pictures of my odometer and bestowed the new quote upon me. As a reminder, my payment for the past six months was $727.88, or ~$121 a month. Taking into account the freshly-minted speeding ticket on my record, I wasn't sure what to expect. Drum roll please:</p>
<br/>
<p><em>&#8230; drum roll sounds &#8230;</em></p>
<br/>
<p><strong>$421.88!</strong></p>
<br/>
<p>That there is downright reasonable. My monthly "rent" for the next six months is going to be ~$70, a pleasant 40% reduction from the past six months. Plus, because I showed up two weeks before my policy needed to be renewed, they're going to refund me the difference on my current policy, prorated for these next two weeks. That adds another $26 to my rent-savings, making my monthly bill ~$116 a month for the past six months. I'll update the savings calculator formula once I get the exact numbers in the mail, and I have a new algorithm that can handle my changing insurance costs, which I'll upload soon. I have a few other fancy-shmancy updates (like working search functionality) on the way as well, so watch out for those.</p>
<p><em>But Brandon, you got a speeding ticket, shouldn't that have made your insurance, like, a <strong>BILLION DOLLARS</strong>?</em></p>
<p>I would have thought so too, but then I remembered a speeding ticket I got about three years ago. It was two years and nine months old when I started my policy six months ago, which means that it still counted against me and drove up the rate on my original policy. But tickets only count against you for three years apparently, so it "expired" about three months ago. And if I hadn't promptly replaced it with a new speeding ticket, it's very likely my new policy quote would have been <em>even lower</em>. There are other factors too, my age and marital status makes insurance more expensive, but my Good Driver discount (that I somehow get???) and Science Degree discount (I love how that's a thing) help to balance it out. In any case: 55 minutes could save you 40% or more on car insurance.***

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p><em>Note: Throughout this post, I use phrases like "yesterday" and "last night". In reality, it was two nights ago, but I'm slow to get my thoughts onto (digital) paper.</em></p>
<p>The Bay Area is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco#Climate">fairly</a> <a href="http://ca.gov/drought/">dry place</a>. In the past six months of my living out here, it has only "rained" a handful of times. I use the term rain lightly, because it's barely ever more than a passing drizzle. In spite of the precipitation's timidity, people have become so adjusted to the area's micro-climate that they act (and drive) like it's a flash flood. Yesterday, it rained. But it didn't "rain", no, this wasn't Your Dad's Rain&#8482; at all. Yesterday, I experienced my first Californian downpour.</p>
<h2>A Rude Awakening</h2>
<p>Falling asleep to the sounds of a light drizzle has actually proved fairly relaxing. The measured, metallic taps of gentle raindrops on the thin box roof haven't been cause for much concern. Unfortunately, that doesn't hold true when showers become full-on rainstorms, a la last night. The metallic taps turn into a two-year old's one-man pot-and-pan all-percussion band, a perfect maelstrom of discordant tones. It was more than enough to wake me up a few times over the course of the night: groggy, confused, and wondering if my life was in danger at the hands of the monsters pounding on my walls.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>I've mentioned <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5634387206995968">"The Hole"</a> before, a looming Home Improvement project I've been trying (lackadaisically) to figure out how to address. It hasn't really been an issue, the pecking crows I get every so often aren't a big deal, and the few sporadic spurts of rainfall I've seen so far never let more than a few drops of water inside. Last night, my relationship with rain took a turn for the worse. Dwarfed by the din of rain using my roof as a bongo drum, I could faintly hear a metered drip sound, maybe once every few seconds. This is a Bad Thing&#8482;: a drip every few minutes I can ignore, but at this frequency, I'm dealing with a pretty substantial amount of water. Too much water potentially means mold or mildew, or rotting away the wood, or making the truck <em>extra</em> humid during the day, which in turn makes it a breeding ground for sadness (read: bugs). So I begrudgingly rolled out of bed (at 3:26 AM) and took a look at the situation. Sure enough, the area around the hole was providing a slow, but steady stream of water droplets, and aggressively placing them on my floor. Time to spring into action.</p>
<h2>The (Very Temporary) Solution</h2>
<p>I'm no stranger to leaky roofs; my childhood home had its fair share of drip spots. The living room and my bedroom were particularly bad offenders, but we'd just grab a few pots from the kitchen, gingerly place them on the carpet, and not think much more of it. As it turns out, I don't have <del>m</del>any pots in the truck. I did however, have an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DPNBVU">empty tub of protein powder</a> that I hadn't had a chance to throw away yet. But alas, the drip was in the corner of the truck, and water was splashing all over the wooden railings before it hit the ground. I first attempted to tape the tub to the wall/ceiling, but all I had was carpenter's tape and the angle was all wrong anyway. I needed a way to divert the water away from the wall, and funnel it down into the tub.</p>
<p>Then I remembered about the new clothes rack I've yet to finish. The hollow metal rod is ever so slightly longer than the width of the truck, and I've been taking my sweet time cutting it with a hack saw (which takes <strong>forever</strong>). As a result, it's been sitting on the ground for approximately two months, clanging obnoxiously to remind me of its presence anytime I drive anywhere. Anyway, I maneuvered one end of the rod up to the leak, jammed the other end into the tub, and then used a bin full of random stuff to hold it in place. The end result is pictured above, and I like to think that MacGyver would be proud.</p>
<p>It was still raining when I woke up again at 5:30 AM, and the makeshift bucket had actually collected a fairly impressive amount of water. Was the stopgap a success? I like to think so.</p>
<h2>The Longer-Term Solution</h2>
<p>Even though it doesn't rain here much, <em>fixing</em> the leak is a much more attractive option than just <em>managing</em> the leak. Theoretically, I could just rig up the pipe/tub combination every time it started raining, but that's more of a cop-out than anything else. What happens if I'm away for a few days and it rains? I can't keep the pipe there all the time, it's not stable enough to stay in place while I'm driving. Plus, do I really want to keep an empty tub around <em>all</em> the time? That's just clutter, and I'm not one for clutter.</p>
<p>The issue is that the damaged area isn't just one material. The outside looks like sheet metal, and the inside is some sort of fiberglass composite. I could just throw some epoxy putty over the wound, but I have my doubts about how well that would hold/keep out water. I'll have to call a few different places (mechanics, glass companies, Ford-certified maintenance centers, etc) and see if anyone can fix the whole thing at once. And if it takes them more than a day to do it, I have to find a place to stay. Not a big deal, but the combination of all the aforementioned obstacles probably explains why, after six months of owning the truck, the damned hole is still there.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I promised a mega Q&amp;A, I'm delivering a mega Q&amp;A. I had upwards of 750 questions, so I took some of the most popular (and least creepy) ones, scrubbed out the personal info, fixed some spelling, did a bit of rephrasing, and tossed them up here.</p>
<h2>Bring In The Questions</h2>
<p><em><strong>Why don't you have ads? / Why don't you monetize the blog? / Have you considered selling your soul to the highest bidder?</strong></em></p>
<p>As much as I love the tagline "This truck lifestyle brought to you by Home Depot", I honestly have no intentions of making money off this blog. This is a hobby for me, a vehicle for catharsis and documentation, so that when I'm 65 and (probably) a well-adjusted member of society, I can look back at this blog and laugh at my past antics. I have the attention-span of a small child, and my memory is abnormally bad for someone my age, so this blog takes the place of my seriously-lacking long-term memory capabilities. As an aside, thank you to the guy who estimated my server costs and sent me an anonymous tip, you totally didn't have to do that and I appreciate the gesture. If I were better at managing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/datastore/">Datastore</a> queries, your estimate would have been pretty close, but that's a story for a future post.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why don't you live in an RV or a camper | trailer or housecar | motor home or conversion van | white or brown rice | black or pinto beans?</strong></em></p>
<p>This was probably the most common question I got asked (not the Chipotle part), aside from "Where do I go to the bathroom?", which I answered <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5113880120393728">here</a> a few months ago. I know I've totally blown the whole "low profile" thing, but one big reason I got a truck was because it's much less conspicuous than an RV. If you see an RV in a corporate parking lot, your reaction is "Someone <em>definitely</em> lives there. Like, that's totally someone's home". In a corporate setting, large white box trucks are moving around constantly, and you develop a sort of selective blindness towards them. The other big reason I got a truck, decidedly less comfortable than an RV, is <em>because</em> I <strong>don't</strong> want to be comfortable. Affording myself cushy modern comforts means I'd likely get comfortable just hanging out, and not doing anything enriching or productive or fun. The truck isn't comfortable: it's unbearably hot (over 100&#176; F) between the hours of 11-5 PM, it doesn't have a bathroom or windows, in fact, it barely has anything at all. That's a good thing. It keeps me out of it during the day, it's hard to sleep in and laze around when you're borderline being cooked alive. It forces me to go out and explore the area around me: I go on long bike rides or explore San Francisco, or maybe I'll grab my Kindle and read some travel books in a quaint cafe. I was well-aware of how uncomfortable a truck would be when I bought it, the discomfort is a tool to save me from myself. I've said it before and I'll say it again: if you're spending a lot of time in a small box (literally or metaphorically), you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why don't you include Commuting Costs | Truck Resale Value | Food | Electricity | Hot Water | Other Utilities | Car Insurance | Postage | The Price of Tea in China in the savings calculator formula?</strong></em></p>
<p>The savings calculator is meant to be a <strong>conservative rough estimate</strong> of how much money I've <strong>currently</strong> saved over renting. I'm not including the potential future money I'd get from selling the truck, because that's not liquid cash I have available to me. That said, I will update the clock soon (with an accompanying post), because my insurance did go up ever so slightly. It didn't go up nearly as much as I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5172785596858368">deserved</a>, which I thought was pretty sweet.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have a Facebook | Instagram | Snapchat | mailing list? / What do you look like? / What is your blood type? / What are your <strong>exact</strong> GPS coordinates? / Why don't you love me? / Are you even listening to me??</strong></em></p>
<p>I do have a Facebook and a Snapchat, but those aren't for consumption by the Internet, they're for my own personal social-ification. As for what I look like: two eyes, one nose (on the larger side), a mouth, hair in all the places you'd expect. I've been told I have a very punchable face, so there's that. Blood type is O+, which makes me a good donor candidate.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are you going to do when winter comes? / Are you aware that winter is a season? / I've heard cold air causes cancer, do you want cancer?</strong></em></p>
<p>This is definitely on my radar, and I'm very aware that the Earth is tilted at approximately 23&#176; and this causes seasons for most of the planet. Hold tight, I'm dedicating a full future post to the inevitable but temporary heat-death of the universe.</p>
<p><em><strong>What's the login button for?</strong></em></p>
<p>Valid question. It serves no purpose for anyone other than me. When <em>I</em> log in, the options at the top of the screen change, and that's how I write my posts. I'll hide it somewhere less obnoxious eventually, but for now, don't worry about it too much.</p>
<p><em><strong>Have you heard of <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> | <a href="http://earlyretirementextreme.com/">ERE</a> | my uncle Greg?</strong></em></p>
<p>I actually had not heard of these places, but now that I have, expect a future post about how I'm applying their advice to box life.</p>
<p><em><strong>I've been reading these posts in chronological order. Some ways through, I got a sinking feeling: is this what it's like to watch a person go mad bit by bit?</strong></em></p>
<p>Having never watched someone go insane bit by bit firsthand, I'm not sure I can answer this one with any degree of confidence. That said, as a human being whose thoughts and opinions are shaped by his experiences, living in a truck has certainly changed my perception of a lot of things: homelessness, happiness, money, human nature; you name it. <em>Personally</em>, I don't think my ideas are tending toward derangement, but that's just my <del>unbiased</del> opinion.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you need a special driver's license to operate the truck?</strong></em></p>
<p>Terrifyingly enough, no. Like some types of RVs, any pasty-faced teenager with a freshly minted license, no special training, and minimal real-world driving experience could hop behind the wheel. I have my CDL license, which is why I'd even considered getting something this large in the first place. The box truck is really just a decommissioned <a href="https://www.budgettruck.com/trucks-add-ons/truckdetails16foot">16' Budget truck</a>.

<p><em><strong>Where do you have stuff shipped to?</strong></em></p>
<p>Sometimes my private mailbox, but most of the time I have it shipped directly to work. They bring packages right to your desk, which is unbelievably convenient.</p>
<p><em><strong>Have you planned how long will you live in the truck?</strong></em></p>
<p>I have not. It's hard to say, too. Certainly I could hop onto <a href="craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> and find an apartment/sell the truck in one fell swoop. The answer I always give people is that I'll stop living in a truck when it's no longer a reasonable solution for me. As of right now, and for the foreseeable future, I'm perfectly contented sleeping in the truck, and I wouldn't even be any happier in an apartment.</p>
<p><em><strong>I thought I'd check out your blog, but now I see you use the modifier "super-" I'm outta here.</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm so stupendously super sorry, seriously.</p>
<p><em><strong>What's wrong with peeing in the woods?</strong></em></p>
<p>If you're camping, nothing at all. If you're twenty feet from your office, everything.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you give box tours?</strong></em></p>
<p>If you're in the area, and can convince me you have no intention of chopping me up into little pieces and feeding me to your multiple pet ferrets, totally!</p>
<hr>
<p>As for everyone who emailed and commented with words of encouragement, links to similar blogs, or tips on how to improve my setup, thank you! I'm still digesting the enormous wealth of information, but over the next few weeks I'll be translating it into "Home Improvement" posts and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3iNxZ8Dww">everything like such as</a>.

<h2>Picture This</h2>
<p>It's midnight and my flight has just landed in Boston, two hours behind schedule. I step out into a crisp September night; the air never tastes like this in California. It's refreshing, but despite it only being 9 PM on the coast that I left from, I'm exhausted. It's been a tiring few days of tying up loose ends before the trip, and staring at a dim screen on a dark plane wasn't exactly conducive to sustaining my consciousness. After counting out 27 complete revolutions of the baggage return carousel, I find my suitcase. I try my best to muster a smile at the rental car kiosk, but the attendant's reaction makes it clear I didn't exactly sell it. The car keys dangling from my index finger, I heave my bag onto the backseat. All that stands between me and sleep is a 100 mile drive down a deserted highway.  I sync the car to my phone over Bluetooth, and throw on a playlist. I opt for a <a href="http://songza.com/listen/noise-rap-songza">"noise rap"</a> playlist, that should keep me awake. A few tolls and I'm on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Turnpike">Pike</a>.</p>
<p>It's 1:30 AM at this point, I hop in the left lane and punch it. Looking outside into the darkness, the only indication that I'm even moving is the steady vibration of the engine and the cracks in the road that whip past my headlights. If I keep a steady speed, I'll probably make it back b&#8212;blue lights go on behind me. Ugh. This isn't my first rodeo, though, I've got this down. Blinker on. Lane shift. Blinker on. Lane shift. Blinker on. Lane shift. Car in park. Hazards on. Roll down window. Shut off car. Keys on dash. Hands at 10 and 2. Sit there and wait. I'm pretty sure I was going 85 mph, so I'll just admit my mistake, apologize, and hopefully be on my way. The speed limit is 65, and the fine is $10 per mile over the speed limit, so I'm looking at a $200 fine. Not the best, but not the worst, and it <em>is</em> entirely my fault after all. With any luck he'll let me off with a warning.</p>
<p>"You know you were going 97?"</p>
<p>97?! I thought th&#8212;</p>
<p>"License and rental agreement please"</p>
<p>He retires to his car to decide my fate. Twenty minutes go by, I realize it's highly unlikely he's writing me a love letter in there. My corneas are searing, they aren't enjoying the sunbath from his face-melting-ly bright spotlight.  The light swerves briefly as he opens and closes the cruiser door.</p>
<p>"Have a nice night."</p>
<h2>Accepting my fate</h2>
<p>The ticket was for a cool $470 (ouch). My theory is that he saw I had an out-of-state (<a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5752142325350400">California</a>) license and really laid on the fines, knowing I'd be unlikely to appeal it. The more likely scenario is that I'm just being bitter: blaming others is easier than admitting character faults. The final charges were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Speeding.</strong> Because I was speeding.</li>
<li><strong>Reckless Driving.</strong> Also because I was speeding.</li>
<li><strong>Failure to keep right.</strong> I <em>was</em> in the left lane, after all.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Brandon, this just seems like a normal speeding ticket, and you totally deserved it. How is any of this truck-related?</em></p>
<p>We're getting there, but for now just know that I paid the ticket and didn't think much more of it.</p>
<h2>Fast-forward a month</h2>
<p>It's a Friday like any other and I'm heading to my private mailbox to pick up my mail. I've got a few credit card promotions, which I immediately toss. More interesting, I've got two letters from the DMV. I open one, and it reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OCT 15, 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>DEAR CALIFORNIA DRIVER,</strong></p>
<p><strong>DUE TO THE LATEST ENTRIES TO YOUR DRIVER RECORD (SEE BELOW), YOU ARE NOW AMONG CALIFORNIA'S WORST DRIVERS, ONE OF THOSE WHO CAUSE THE MOST CRASHES, INJURIES, AND DEATHS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ONE MORE POINT ADDED TO YOUR ALREADY POOR DRIVING RECORD AND YOU WILL MEET THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF A NEGLIGENT-OPERATOR. IF THAT HAPPENS, YOUR DRIVING PRIVILEGE WILL BE IN JEOPARDY.</strong></p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeez, that doesn't sound good. What is all of this about though? Other than that speeding ticket in Boston, I hadn't gotten a ticket in over three years. I look at my attached driving record, which contains the following very helpful table:</p>
<div class="table-responsive">
<table class="table table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>VIOL DT</th>

</div>
<p>Oh god, I see what's going on here. They're counting each offense as a separate citation against me, this isn't promising. Heart racing, I open the second DMV letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OCT 15, 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR DRIVING PRIVILEGE IS SUSPENDED AS OF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOV 18, 2015</span> AS A CONDITION OF PROBATION AND CANNOT BE REINSTATED BEFORE <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAY 17, 2016</span></strong></p>

<p>I'm not normally one for panicking, but I'm definitely struggling to keep calm at this point. This letter clearly states that I'm losing my license for 6 months. Plain and simple. In between bouts of freaking out, I pull myself together for just long enough to muse on the wording of the letters. California's worst drivers? Poor driving record? Most crashes, injuries, and deaths? Calm down DMV, I was the only car on a five lane highway at two in the morning, it's not like I drove clean through a shopping mall on Black Friday.</p>
<h2>Gathering My Thoughts</h2>
<p>This wasn't a contingency I was prepared for. It had never even crossed my mind. I can live without having a car for transportation, that's not a big deal. But what am I supposed to do, just find a spot where I can leave it for <strong>six months</strong>? And did the cop who wrote my ticket know he was taking away my license by piling on those charges? The letters made it incredibly clear what the consequences of driving without a license were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IF YOU DRIVE WITHOUT A VALID LICENSE, YOU CAN BE ARRESTED. YOUR CAR CAN BE IMPOUNDED AND SOLD.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So not only can I be arrested, but my car can literally be sold at auction? That kind of raises the stakes, you know, <strong>because I live in my car</strong>. Driving without a license could literally make me homeless, and not in the fun, cushy, <em>voluntary</em> way that I'm currently homeless.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the letter, it says I can schedule a hearing, which I resolve to do first thing Monday morning.</p>
<h2>Here Goes Everything</h2>
<p>Five minutes before my scheduled phone hearing (I didn't even know that was a thing), I get a call from who I presume to be the DMV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, is this Brandon? We took a look at your case and are calling to tell you we cancelled the hearing, your license is not being suspended. We'll send you a letter confirming this. Have a great day!</p>
<p><em>-Overly Cheerful DMV Lady</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well then, that was anticlimactic. I don't know whether it was a computer glitch or just miscommunication between the states involved, but it's over. I would much preferred if it had not happened in the first place, because I spent the whole weekend having a perpetual stress-induced aneurysm, but that's just life I guess. Luckily, I don't have to worry about any speeding tickets in the near future&#8230;the truck doesn't even go that fast.</p>

<em>Source: <span>Me parked in a small shopping center between lessons today, blending in exceptionally well. Unapologetically ripped from <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat</a></span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>One of the perks of the truck that I always mention is its mobility. Regardless of where on the planet I put it, the box is still <em>my</em> room, and once I'm inside, the details of the surrounding world are reduced to nothing more than background noise. Theoretically, I can just park anywhere and make that my home for the night.  In reality however, I very rarely spend the night anywhere other than a corporate parking lot, save a few digressions parking downtown after a late night at the bars. The lack of nearby, easy to access showers/facilities is a pretty strong deterrent for me. Tonight however, I find myself in a mildly amusing situation. I'm currently sitting on my bed writing this post (that's not the amusing part), but I'm almost 20 miles away from my usual hideout, and I can hear rhythmic bass thumps coming from the Quincea&#241;era happening not 50 ft away (that's totally the amusing part).</p>
<br/>
<p>Wait, what was that last bit? Okay, let me back up a bit.</p>
<br/>
<p>In <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5636470266134528">this post</a>, I mentioned that I got my motorcycle license so I could get a faster electric bike. What I should have said, more accurately, was that I got my motorcycle <em>permit</em> and I had signed up for motorcycle <a href="http://www.bikesmartmct.com/"><em>lessons</em></a> to get my full-fledged motorcycle <em>license</em>. Well it just so happens that those lessons are this currently-occurring weekend: the three sessions were this morning at 6:30 AM, this evening at right now, and tomorrow morning at 6:30 AM. Unfortunately this means I'll have to postpone my break-even party, likely until the weekend after next.</p>
<p>So anyway, the lessons take place in a community center, which happened to also be hosting a Quincea&#241;era (and a wedding and maybe even a Bar Mitzvah, all simultaneously). After completing the relatively strange experience of taking a multiple-choice test while listening to pulsing traditional Spanish music remixed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(rapper)">Drake</a>, I came outside to find my car completely blocked in/surrounded/immobilized by the vehicles (I assume) of party-goers. Interesting. After taking a second to assess the various facets of the situation, I formulated the following potential courses of action:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wait it out.</strong> I could just wait for a few cars to leave. By the looks of this mess, I'm waiting on at least three different cars to move before there's even a remote possibility that I'll be able to maneuver my awkward hulking mass of faux housecar out of this parking lot without it getting <em>real</em> intimate with some of the surrounding cars. Problem with this idea is that I have no idea when this Quince-wedding Mitzvah ends. It seems pretty rowdy; for all I know they may just be breaking out the Tequila<a href="http://www.manischewitz.com/">schewitz</a> now, and it won't be winding down until 6 AM.</li>
<li><strong>Find the car owners.</strong> This has all the maneuverability problems of the previous option, plus I have to hunt down these people (somehow) and hope they aren't completely inebriated. And I have to consider how much everyone would appreciate some random guy running onto their dance floor with a list of license plates. Informal, one-person survey says they wouldn't like it very much.</li>
<li><strong>Just plow through their cars.</strong> The front fender of the truck already looks like a piece of abstract sculpture, would a few more dents <em>really</em> matter? In all seriousness though, I didn't actually consider this a viable option&#8230;for more than, like, a minute.</li>
<li><strong>Just sleep here.</strong> Given my inability to structure posts for dramatic effect, you already know this is the option I chose. But think about it: Do I really want to drive 20 miles back "home", wake up at 5:45 AM, and drive 20 miles back here? The much more appealing option is to drive <strong>zero</strong> miles, and wake up at 6:29:59 AM. I can wash up in the bathroom and I have all the fresh changes of clothes I need with me already. As for showering, I'm going to smell like exhaust from riding in a tight circle behind nine other motorcycles for five hours tomorrow morning anyway, I might as well just shower once I get back.</li>
</ol>
<p>So yeah, given that list of two mediocre options, one downright bad option, and one fairly reasonable (relative to everything else in my life) option, I think I made the right choice.</p>

<em>Source: <span>What my past two days have looked like</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Wow, that was intense. This blog used to just be for my family and friends to check in and make sure I hadn't died in some horrific truck-related accident, but since I made the highly questionable call to share my story publicly, it's been a whole different story all together. It's been a crazy few days, and I have a ton of thoughts on it. This is going to be my longest post by far, and I apologize in advance if it reads like one long rambling truck-man manifesto. I'm going to do my best to sort my thoughts out, so strap in and here we go.</p>
<h2>Raw Stats</h2>
<p>I'm not going to link to any of them, but there were well over 6,000,000 (yes, six million) views on articles about my living situation in the first day and a half. I've seen various forms of my story published on 25+ media outlets, and several live news broadcasts. This blog received 2,000,000 requests the first day alone, enough to bring it down for a minute or two right after the first article hit. I've been contacted by no less than 10 people internally at my company, 20 people externally, and 500 people between comments on this blog and emails. A few people tracked me down and friended me on social media (impressive, I'm not even mad). By any definition, my story went viral, for better or for worse.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>I've read emails from many people who've subjected themselves to living situations similar to mine, sometimes under less cheery circumstances. Even though I'm perfectly contented with my (self-inflicted) living situation, it was encouraging to read from other people who've worked through the same physical and cognitive barriers. I've even heard from people who are currently living in <em>nearly identical</em> situations. I've never had a network of fellow truck/van-dwellers to talk to (<a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5665117697998848">this guy</a> has since left), so if nothing else it's nice to know that other people are just as crazy as I am. The tone of peoples' correspondences to me was overwhelmingly positive, and that was definitely refreshing. I've read through tons of wonderful advice about potential "Home Improvement" tasks, like fixing that damned hole in the front of the box, ways I can improve my dresser, or how I could build a better bike rack. I've had people offer to decorate the inside and outside of the truck, and even offer me places to stay around the world when I start travelling. The kindness and generosity of the world is certainly not lost on me, and I appreciate all of it greatly.</p>
<h3>Real Conversations</h3>
<p>I have dozens of reasons why I do what I do, but the easiest one to latch onto is that the Bay Area is expensive to live in, and I normally leave it at that. It turns out that's a fantastically touchy subject, but it was nice to see some very well-reasoned arguments on a bevy of relevant topics. I read some great discussions: whether they be about what the "American Dream" means today, or even solutions for San Francisco to start rectifying its housing problem. Though I have to admit, it's <em>incredibly</em> weird watching thousands of complete strangers argue about the various facets of your life. Glad that's almost over with.</p>
<h3>In The Black</h3>
<p>We're living in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/20/entertainment/back-to-the-future-day-feat/">Marty McFly's future</a>, and (according to my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5764640680181760">nearly arbitrary formula</a>) I've broke even! I've successfully avoided paying rent for long enough to justify purchasing the truck, and it's all sunshine and gravy from here. I promised a break-even party, and I'm still working out the details, but that'll definitely be this weekend for anyone who wants to join in the festivities. Thank you to every one who congratulated me on this pretty exciting (if I do say so myself) milestone.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>There were a lot of great things that came out of the past few days, but unfortunately the Internet isn't a vast wonderland of sunshine and rainbows. While everyone I've talked to in real-life has been, at the very least, understanding of what I'm doing, the anonymous, snarled tendrils of the Web aren't quite as forgiving. Maybe I can chock up the local niceness to the general liberalness and frivolousness that pervades the Bay Area, who knows? In any case, I certainly had a lot of material to think about and reflect on over the course of the day.</p>
<h3>Common Criticisms/Complaints/Comments</h3>
<p>For better or for worse, the Internet is a bastion of free speech and gives people the power of anonymity. Having spent years taking cursory glances at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> comments, I should have known better than to delve into the cesspool otherwise known as the comments section on articles. But alas, I let curiosity get the best of me and took a look. I'm the last person who'd be offended by comments on the Internet, and I've mentioned before that if you're going to do something as crazy and fringe as live in a truck, you need to be comfortable with yourself. Being comfortable means knowing how to take a joke, and I found most of the jokes about me pretty funny. Some of them were tragically misinformed or otherwise unknowledgeable though, and here's my feeble attempt to set the record straight:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Stuffed Animals.</strong> I'm not actually sure how this came up in the first place, but the dregs of the Internet really latched onto the fact that I own a few stuffed animals, and that fact persisted through pretty much every article I read. And I'll admit, as a grown man living in a truck, stuffed animals are about the only decoration that could possibly make my living situation look any creepier. Plus, if you presented a younger version of me with that information, he'd probably find the stuffed animals just as weird. The reality is that they were given to me by a friend, and they're one of the few possessions I've attached sentiment to. Everything else in the truck has a well-defined utility and purpose, the stuffed animals are just reminders that I've lived other lives outside of my current situation.  I don't talk to them or pretend they're alive, I just keep them to remember where I've been. So yeah, they're undoubtedly weird, but they're also one of the signs that I'm still human.</li>
<li><strong>I'm a barbarian.</strong> I don't pee in the woods. I've never peed in the woods, and I have no intention of peeing in the woods. I use the facilities on campus, like a reasonable, civilized human being. There are no buckets or other waste capture/disposal utilities in the truck. I repeat: <strong>While in the truck, I perform no bodily function that creates waste</strong>. Okay fine, if you're being particularly pedantic, I do breathe, which releases CO<sub>2</sub> and <em>I guess</em> could be considered waste, but that's it. I'm not <a href="http://www.beargrylls.com/">Bear Grylls</a>, nor do I have any intention of emulating his lifestyle.</li>
<li><strong>Non-existent social/romantic life.</strong> I'm working on <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5754903989321728">being less judgmental</a> myself, so I'm not going to give people flak for their opinions of me. And trust me, I'm the first one to <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5741031244955648">joke about my romantic prospects</a>. But since everyone seemed really worked up about it: you can take solace in knowing that I have a great network of friends, and people are <em>far more</em> accepting of the truck life than I would have previously believed. People seemed really eager to paint me as some sort of goblin who works 16 hours a day and is afraid of sunlight and women, which I probably should have expected.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Just Plain Selfish</h3>
<p>I can't remember what was going through my head when I agreed to talk about this publicly, but it's pretty much the exact opposite of everything I've been advocating in my lifestyle. You know, things like <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5743114304094208">subtlety</a>, for example. The whole reason I got a truck instead of an RV was to maintain a low profile, well it turns out that works <strong>much</strong> better if you don't broadcast pictures of your truck on Good Morning America (my bad). The worst part though is that, as I've mentioned, there are plenty of other people in the area doing similar things, and I very well may have just ruined it for everyone by drawing so much attention to it. I sincerely hope that I haven't caused problems for any other truck people. If I have, I'm sorry, it was selfish of me to make such a spectacle of myself.</p>
<h3>What makes me interesting?</h3>
<p>If you aren't a fan of hearing about the grim realities of the world, skip this section.<p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_United_States">Over 600,000 people</a> in the United States are homeless, and we're the most affluent nation on the planet. By that metric, there's nothing particularly interesting about <em>my</em> flavor of homelessness. It's that I'm choosing to do so, or that I'm doing it while working at a high-profile tech company. And somehow that makes it more interesting, or fun even? <em>Real homelessness</em> is a systemic issue that doesn't get exposure because it's a decidedly uncomfortable topic. People barely scraping by working minimum wage jobs and living out of their cars isn't a news story, or particularly glamorous. My story makes a great, Buzzfeed-style headline. But when it comes down to it, my life is perfectly fine. I've said many times before that in my worst case scenario, I simply get an apartment like a normal human being. But where are the stories for the people who don't have that luxury?  Let's be incredibly clear about this: If I was struggling to get by and living out of a car, this wouldn't be news; it'd just be someone's harsh reality. It's especially tragic because I encouraged it, generating tens of thousands of dollars in ad revenue for these media outlets.* If  this is something that resonates with you, donate to an organization that actually does something about it, like <a href="https://handup.org/">HandUp</a> or <a href="http://www.homelessvoice.org/">Homeless Voice</a>.</p>
<h2>Clarification</h2>
<p>I saw a lot of misinformation and questions and criticisms in the comments on various sites. For all of the questions people asked me directly on this site, I'll address them all in a mega-Q&amp;A soon, so sit tight. But I'm going to address some of the bigger stuff here.</p>
<h3>Brandon, where's your money?</h3>
<p>I saw a bunch of people crunched the numbers and determined that I should have been able to save more money than I actually am and pay down my loans faster. However, they weren't able to take into account that I was maxing out my 401k and HSA to lower my tax burden and utilize the generous corporate matching program available to me. Those investments have higher returns than the fairly low interest rate on my federal loans. Fear not, I'm working on a post that'll detail my finances in thorough, painstaking detail. But in the meantime, rest assured that I don't have a raging drug addiction that's siphoning up my hard-earned funds.</p>
<h3>Brandon, why is your truck so ugly?</h3>
<p>As is pretty obvious from the truck shots circulating the Internet: my home is not a pretty place. In fact, I'd venture as far as saying it's downright unattractive. It's fairly old, there's graffiti and old sticker residue on the outside, etc. I do my best to keep it away from the public eye, but I thought it was funny that people were expecting something nicer. Like in what universe is someone living in a truck likely to have high-class design sensibilities? I'm an engineer, and it definitely shows in my choice of decor. It's spartan and utilitarian, and that's the way I like it. Like I've said before, I'm not using it to impress house guests, I'm using it to sleep and store my clothes, nothing more.</p>
<h3>The Savings Clock</h3>
<p>Brandon, in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5764640680181760">this post</a>, you say your break-even point isn't until October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2015, but it looks like you broke even yesterday, October 19<sup>th</sup>. What gives?</p>
<p>This one was my bad. It turns out <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> uses a more exact algorithm for calculating the duration between two dates, whereas I was making the rough estimate/assumption that each month had 30 days. The ~1% difference in the two algorithms means that I "broke-even" a day before my estimate. As many people have mentioned to me, I'm not counting the value of the truck for if/when I decide to sell it. They're right, but the calculator is an estimate of how much money I've <em>currently</em> saved, to include the potential future earnings from selling the truck wouldn't be honest or reflective of what I'm trying to show.</p>
<h2>Housekeeping Notes</h2>
<p>I'm still reading through (and responding to) all of the emails sent to the address I created yesterday (brandon@TheNameOfThisWebsite.com). Give me another day or two, as you can imagine it's been a bit hectic. A couple people requested a mailing list or some way to subscribe. I currently have an RSS feed, though whether or not it works is a different matter entirely (I've never used it). I'll set some time aside this weekend to see if I can set up a mailing list or something equally useful.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, I'm glad my 15 minutes of fame are (hopefully) winding down. Thank you to everyone who reached out and shared past experiences or gave me tips on how to improve the truck, I read and appreciated all of it, and I'll continue to respond to emails and comments directed my way. Like I said, it's been one hell of a day, and I'm hoping to retire to my truck now for a nice, quiet night.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>It's been a while since <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5676830073815040">my last Home Improvement post</a>, which is bad because it means I'm not improving the truck. And trust me, the truck certainly does have <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5634387206995968">areas</a> <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5747976207073280">for</a> <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5653164804014080">improvement</a>. Anyway, I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5636470266134528">mentioned</a> that I got a new bike recently. This was great but, like every time I get something new, it posed an issue.</p>
<h2>The Situation</h2>
<p>I'm now in possession of a large, 50 pound hunk of metal and rubber, which I have to store <em>somewhere</em>. It makes sense to keep it with me, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's a $3,000+ piece of equipment</li>
<li>For some reason bikes in the Bay Area are <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Here-s-how-to-get-your-stolen-bike-back-in-S-F-5448933.php">especially prone</a> to <a href="http://seismograph.co/stolen-bicycle-map-sf.html">being stolen</a></li>
<li>It just seems silly to keep it anywhere else. If I have to go get it every time I want to use it, doesn't that defeat the purpose? Seriously, who wants to pregame their bike ride with a half-mile walk.<sup><sup>Certainly not me</sup></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>So I made the pretty easy decision to keep the bike safe and sound in the truck when I'm using it. That's all well and good and whatnot, but what happens when I need to drive somewhere? The bike won't stay standing on its own, especially not with my abrupt and punctuated driving style. I'm not just going to lay it down, tie some rope around it, and hope for the best. It has all sorts of fancy parts (derailleur, electric motor, torque sensor, lights, disc brakes, etc), and leaving it to rattle around in the back sounds like a great way to totally and needlessly ruin it. My general strategy for having nice things is to not break them, and I'm going to try my darnedest to keep it up.</p>
<h2>Planning It Out</h2>
<p>So I did some preliminary research. I'm in the unique position of having to choose between a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bike-Lane-Products-Bicycle-Storage/dp/B00GP29VI4">home bike rack</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Allen-Sports-Deluxe-2-Bike-Trunk/dp/B00TRTSAZM">car bike rack</a>. In either case, I knew I needed something pretty heavy duty to accommodate the weight of this bike in all of its electric, motored glory. I quickly realized a home rack wouldn't work out well, because those racks aren't expecting a ton of movement, so they don't bother with any shock-resistance, which could potentially warp the frame of the bike or toss it off the rack if I went over a bump hard enough. After a bit of searching, I decided on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MK5M7E">Truck Bed Bike Rack</a>. I figured that the box is basically a giant truck bed, and I could probably finagle the clamps on properly&#8230;somehow. Plus, the bike being upright but on the ground means that I don't have to worry about it falling, like I would for a ceiling mount or some other fancy wall mount. I placed my order, waited a few days for it to come in, then it was time to get my hands dirty, proverbially speaking.*</p>
<p>Now if you've looked at my past "Home Improvement" posts, there's a pretty consistent theme: I inevitably get something horribly wrong and make my life unnecessarily difficult due to my thorough lack of understanding about how the physical world works. I'm a software engineer: I move electrons and pixels, not wood and metal. Per usual, my problem was that I didn't properly do my research. I was <em>hoping</em> I'd be able to clamp the wooden slats along the sides of the truck in the same way they'd clamp onto the edge of a truck bed. Well, I should have done less <em>hoping</em>, and more <em>measuring</em>, because the wooden slats were <em>ever-so slightly</em> too tall to properly clamp onto, and <em>ever-so slightly</em> too close to the truck wall for the thickness of the clamp.</p>
<h2>Screwing Stuff Together</h2>
<p>Discouraged, but far from ready to admit defeat, I paced around the back of the truck, at the time parked in a random parking lot. After a short eternity, I realized I could unscrew the wooden slat, place the back half of the clamp against the wall, and then pin it into place by screwing the slat back in. The clamp still didn't fit around the wood correctly, but I figured if I tightened it really, really, really well, I could dig the metal clamp straight into the wood, and hopefully that would be stable enough to keep the bike in place. I executed my new plan, gave a couple tugs on the connecting rod as a test (which elicited a cacophony of creaks), and then put the bike into place, wrapping the clamp around the seatpost.</p>
<p>The end result? So far, good. I drove about a mile with the bike <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5697982787747840">secured</a> in the back and it appeared to survive unscathed, no implosions or loss of life. I'm not yet confident enough to claim that a particularly sharp turn won't just rip the wood slat out of the wall and send the bike crashing to the ground, but I've got my fingers crossed.</p>
<p>*<sub><em>The truck is actually pretty clean, I sweep it at least once a week.</em></sub></p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I like to think I'm pretty environmentally friendly. I try to <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5713144022302720">minimize my waste</a>, take quick showers, and not run unnecessary appliances, like heating and cooling systems. I'm definitely not a super earthy-crunchy-Hippie-type, but I'm at least vaguely cognizant of the atrocities I commit against Mother Nature. My main sin against the planet, aside from just being American, is the fact that I run errands in an 11,500 pound tank that gets 8 MPG on a good day. That's bad for at least four different reasons, in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>I weigh ~170 pounds, it's wildly inefficient for me to haul six tons of metal with me to a cafe.</li>
<li>As it turns out, the truck doesn't just fold up and fit in my pocket once I get somewhere. I have to park the stupid thing, and I've noted before how that <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5693417237512192">isn't always easy</a>.</li>
<li>It's also my home. And really, it makes a better home than mode of transportation. Plus, I invariably forget to <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5697982787747840">secure something</a>, and the next time in the box becomes a game of "find and pick up all the stuff that was violently thrown around while you were driving". The joy.</li>
<li>It costs money. I like having money, it's better than not having money because I spent it on 100 million year old plants (read: gasoline) to please my truck-beast.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, you can imagine my elation when I found out that my company was piloting an electric bicycle program. Looking at the list of Bad Things<sup>TM</sup> above, here's how an electric bike would make my life better:</p>
<ol>
<li>It weighs like 50 pounds, which is ~99.6% less than the truck. Much more efficient for moving me places.</li>
<li>Parking a bicycle is infinitely easier than a 20-something foot long truck.</li>
<li>Bicycles are made for taking people places. Moving trucks are meant for taking things places. I'm glad to no longer be forcing a square peg into a round hole.</li>
<li>It's free! It's mine to use as long as I stay with my current employer. I can charge it up at work, and it gets 25+ miles on a single charge. That's enough for a trip to my mailbox and a few local errands.</li>
</ol>
<p>So naturally, I signed up for the program, did the training, and picked up my shiny new toy. The bike is a <a href="http://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/electric/turbo/turbo"> Specialized Turbo</a>. It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedelec">pedalec</a>, which means that it only <em>helps</em> me move along, it doesn't do all the work like a motorcycle would. It has a torque-sensor, so it puts in effort proportional to my own. This is all great, because frankly my cardio sucks, and I can't be bothered to actively work on it. But when you incorporate it into my daily routine, and also let me do it at almost 30 MPH (I got a motorcycle license just so I could get the faster version), I'm much more inclined to play along. I've only had it for four days, but I've already racked up 50 miles on it. I bought a bike rack for the truck so I can take it places with me, but I haven't installed that yet. I'll save that for a separate "Home Improvement" post.</p>
<p>I'm still working out little details, like where I want to mount the rack in the truck (not that there are a ton of choices), and how to get it in and out of the truck smoothly (it's 50 pounds and awkward to maneuver), but overall it's been a total boon to my routine.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I've never really been camping before, so when a friend asked if I wanted to go camping over Labor Day weekend, I gladly accepted. In the past, I've mentioned that living in the truck feels like perpetual camping. Think about it: I practically live outside, I forgo a lot of modern conveniences (namely heat, A/C, and a nearby bathroom), and I fall asleep to the sounds of nature every night (there's a shocking amount of wildlife at the edge of my parking lot). So I expected camping to feel like just another day for me, and I packed for it almost like I'd pack for a normal day: a few t-shirts, a pair of shorts, and my handy dandy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Powerful-Portable-RAVPower-Technology-Connector/dp/B00MPIGPUY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442162162&amp;sr=8-1">battery pack</a>. So, how was it?</p>
<p>When your entire life fits in a parking space, leaving it for a few days (on twenty minutes of notice) is super easy. There's no sense of homesickness or yearning for first-world amenities. You never catch yourself thinking, "Gee, I miss my television and refrigerator right now"...because you didn't have those things to begin with. In the same vein, because you have so little to even consider bringing with you, the cognitive overhead for packing is minimal. In a house overflowing with assorted objects of questionable utility, you have to mentally iterate through them and decide what makes sense to bring with you on a three-day excursion. Like I said above, I just tossed all my useful belongings in a bag, and that was that. Granted, if I was camping alone or with other truck people, this wouldn't have worked in the slightest. It's only because everyone else was able to bring things like tents, utensils, and food that I was able to pack so lightly.</p>
<p>As for the actual weekend, it was a total blast. There wasn't anything truck-related for the three days I was away, save for my recounting of a few particularly strange truck stories,. I certainly didn't drive the truck to the campgrounds, I doubt it would even have survived the journey. It was just three days of cooking over an open fire, stargazing with a clear view of the Milky Way, drinking to excess, and swimming in a lake of questionable quality water, all perfectly legitimate camping activities.</p>
<p>It wasn't entirely sunshine and rainbows though. Sleeping on the cold, hard ground did make me miss my truck bed a <em>little</em> bit, and it's true that I've been pampered by my corporate fitness and hygiene facilities over the past few months. We did have a bathroom at the campsite, which came with a complimentary coating of dirt and a potpourri of random insect infestations. Several bouts of <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5759778777202688">tiny, uninvited truck guests</a> have made me pretty unconcerned with bugs, so I definitely appreciated the unintentional conditioning. Those negligible gripes aside (one could and should even consider them part of the experience), truck life was good preparation for camping, and in turn, camping was a nice departure from truck life.</p>

<em>Source: <span>A poorly-drawn metaphor for a balance of work and life. I call it: The TruckYang</span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>People have all sorts of suggestions for how you should spend your 20s, and they land pretty much everywhere on the spectrum. Some say you should work extra hard to provide yourself with a solid foundation for the future. After all, you're young and void of life's later obligations, put that time to good use. Others say you shouldn't squander it toiling your best years away in monotony. As is probably evident from some of my other writings (read: ramblings), I fall somewhere in the middle. On one hand, I recognize that I'm setting up the foundation for the rest of my life right now (little to no expenses, investing early, yadda yadda yadda). But on the other hand, as I'm one to note, I only get to be this young once and I'll be damned if I don't make some memories to reminisce about when I'm old and gray. Plus, one of the main reasons I decided on the truck life was to minimize the time until I could start travelling.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is all just a long-winded introduction for the actual topic at hand: striking a work-life balance when <strong>you literally live at work</strong>. Sounds tricky, right? When your lifestyle blurs the line between working and just living, how do you make sure that they don't amalgamate into one never-ending workday? Early on, this was a legitimate issue for me, and I didn't even realize it because of how natural it felt. During the week, I would wake up, head to a gym (at work), shower (at work), work (obviously at work), and hang around the office (working, mainly) until it was time to go to sleep. Rinse and repeat. It took me a few weeks of this routine to realize that I was spending 70-80% of my waking time working. I ever-so-briefly became a zombie, constantly and mindlessly working away at whatever problem I was given, reduced to a machine that turned food into code and waste. It wasn't that my workload was too high, <em>I just didn't know what else to do</em>, and that happened to be the path of least resistance. However, after a few months of experimentation, I think I've figured out a reasonable formula, but I still have to be very cognizant of what I'm doing, lest I slip back into my bad work habits of yestermonth.</p>
<h2>Separation of Truck and Work</h2>
<p>The first thing I had to do was to realize that just because I'm relying on work for most of my basic needs (showers, bathrooms, food, laundry, gym, etc), I can still draw a clear line between when I'm working and furthering the goals of the company I work for, and when I'm enjoying my own free time. Recognizing this was the first step, once I was able to understand the difference, I just had to define which was when, and add a little bit of regimentation into the mix.</p>
<h3>Set Work Hours - And Stick to Them</h3>
<p>The first thing I did was put my foot down and establish what time of day I would be working. Any other time of day, that's Brandon time. I decided that 8-9 hours a day of working was more than enough to get everything done that I needed/wanted to. There is very little I currently work on that is too important to wait until tomorrow if it's getting late. And I figure I normally workout, shower, and head to breakfast by 8 am, so 8 until 4 or 4:30 pm sounds like a pretty reasonable work schedule. Okay, let's say I've done my time and 4 o'clock rolls around, what's next?</p>
<h3>Find Places to Go After Work</h3>
<p>I quickly realized that it wasn't quite enough to just say that work ended at 4, I had to physically get up and go somewhere. Sure, I could just sit at my desk and work on my blog, or plan my travels, or code up some side projects, but being physically located at my desk meant that I was much more likely to accidentally get wrangled back into doing work stuff. Plus, being at my desk for 10-12 hours a day, every day, probably looks pretty strange to my coworkers. The solution? Go somewhere else. If I don't have any other plans, I have a mental list of locations to hang out and enjoy my own time. Some of them are just different places on campus far from my desk, others are cafes downtown, and still others are random places near where I pick up mail from my faux mailbox. So that covers the week, but you're going to need a new game plan for when Saturday shows up at your truck door.</p>
<h3>Planning Weekend Activities</h3>
<p>I like to wake up bright and early Saturday morning and do all of the week's laundry.* Up until last month, I had a laundry room in the same building as my office. That sounds super convenient, but what ended up happening was that I'd hang out at my desk while I was waiting for my laundry to finish, and inevitably my feeble mind would wander back onto work topics. I'm sure someone with a better understanding of basic human psychology would be able to explain why that happens, but I certainly don't have that answer. In any case, doing laundry in a building other than my own, far from the temptation of productivity, solved that problem. My routine is now doing laundry and exercise in parallel, killing two proverbial birds with one proverbial stone. That only accounts for 2 or 3 hours of my whole weekend though, surely there's more to it. After all, the truck likes to pretend it's an oven during the day. It's not as if I can just hang out in there all afternoon, and I actually prefer it that way. At some point I'll dedicate a whole post on how to have a successful night on the town with the truck in tow. For now, just know that I <strong>pre</strong>fill my weekends with cafes, trips to the city, parks, errands, events, movies, and questionably appropriate levels of alcohol. Note the emphasis on the "pre" part, if I don't plan things out in advance, I'll inevitably end up back at my desk, which I consider a Bad Thing<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<h3>Know Your Limitations</h3>
<p>Living in a truck makes some types of fairly normal leisure activities more difficult. Namely, not having a TV/reliable internet (and by extension cable/Netflix) means I can't just plop on the couch, throw on some <em>Beverly Honey Hills Ninja Boo Boo Warrior</em>, and let my brain matter leak out of my ears. I can't watch Netflix on my laptop in the truck because I don't get quite good enough reception, and I just feel <em>off</em> doing it at work. I'm okay with this though, because it almost forces me to find something more productive to do, which I don't mind in the slightest.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is that having a life of your own outside of work is important, truck or not. Truck living is easier in some ways, harder in others, and just plain stranger in some places. But making a concerted effort to only give a portion of your soul to your employer means that you still have some left over to put towards your dreams. Maybe a little too sappy and idealized, but the sentiment is there.</p>
<p>*<sub><em>Sidenote: This was definitely a good habit to get into. It turns out a full laundry bag of sweaty gym clothes can make a small confined space, say a box truck for example, smell pretty bad, pretty quickly. So regularly purging the demons of well-worn clothing from my life improves my quality of living fairly dramatically.</em></sub></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>In a world where everything is prepackaged, replaceable, and easily disposable, trash is tragically an unavoidable by-product of living. Whether it's paper towels, tissues, plastic packaging, cleaning products, cardboard containers, clothing tags, receipts, pretty much every transaction you make is going to generate some type of waste. And waste is, like, generally bad, right? It takes up space, serves no real purpose, wastes resources and energy, and most importantly for truck folk, there's really no good place to put it.</p>
<p>If you live in a house, you probably put your trash on the curb once a week and the trash fairy comes and takes it away. You either pay the town or a contractor to send this fairy to your house. If you live in an apartment building or complex, chances are there's a communal trash heap/chute that you dump your undesirables into. As far as I'm aware, there's no truck-to-truck trash removal service, and quite frankly it would be pretty weird if there was. My strategy for managing waste was non-existent up until recently, and that was definitively a Bad Thing<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<h2>Minimizing Waste</h2>
<p>You're going to have to deal with some amount of trash, it's inevitable. However, the raw magnitude of refuse you generate will vary dramatically with how proactive you are in controlling it.  Here are some of the things that help me minimize what I'm throwing away:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Buy less disposables.</strong> This one makes sense. Instead of going for paper towels, go for cloths instead. Instead of cleaning wipes, buy cleaning solution and some quality sponges. The whole <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/recycle">"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"</a> mentality works wonders here.</li>
<li><strong>Buy the more expensive items used.</strong> Most of the time, when you buy something used, it's not going to have the original packaging, which (in my experience) accounts for most of what you have to throw away. It's always extra packaging: bubble wrap, cardboard, packing slips, instruction manuals etc. Buying used stuff eliminates that step, especially if you pick it up in person instead of having it shipped. This was my main antagonist, the Ikea packaging was ~50% of all the trash I had built up.</li>
<li><strong>Just buy less stuff.</strong> A bit of reiterating what I was talking about in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5657382461898752">this post</a>. Ask yourself, "Do I really need this? Does this <em>actually</em> improve my life in any articulable, perceptible way?" If the answer is no, great! You've just saved yourself money, space, and the burden of having more trash to toss out.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Managing Waste</h2>
<p>Like I said, it all started with <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5676830073815040">a trip to Ikea</a>. I had successfully (and painfully) assembled the dresser, and I was left with a huge mass of cardboard and plastic wrap and all the other various fixings of the packaging. I did what seemed like the reasonable thing to do at the time: I took all of the trash, threw it in a big bag, and dumped the bag in a corner of the truck. This would have been fine and all, except that the bag was still there three months later. And every time I cleaned anything, or bought anything, or did pretty much anything other than sleep, there would always be some new piece of trash. Naturally, I threw it into that ever-growing black hole of bad decisions and didn't think any more of it.</p>
<p>It probably doesn't sound all that bad, it just sounds like a trash bag. Except that at this point in the story, it's filled with who knows how many random house-cleaning chemicals, discarded shampoo bottles, and random other waste that I've accumulated by being alive. Not only was I sleeping within a few feet of this near-definite biohazard, but if I've learned anything, it's that <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5759778777202688">bugs will eat pretty much anything</a>. And I had a whole lot of anything and everything in that bag. I wouldn't be entirely shocked if that's what was attracting all of my bug buddies.</p>
<p>And I'd still have that same mystery bag in my truck, had a friend not needed some help moving. Luckily they did though, unintentionally giving me the perfect opportunity to quietly rid myself of 20-ish pounds of God knows what into a dumpster in their apartment complex. But clearly that's not a sustainable solution; I'm not going to be consistently helping friends move. That said, I'm sure my friends enjoy knowing someone in possession of a moving truck. But still, if I can't rely on throwing trash in friends' dumpsters, what are my options?</p>
<h3>Uhh, a landfill?</h3>
<p>This is a pretty obvious option. You have trash, you need to get rid of it, you take it to the landfill. Simple and easy. The first problem is that most landfills don't like to take random trash. They'd prefer if you sorted it, placed it in separate bags, and other completely reasonable requests that I had no interest in complying with. Not a huge deal, I'm sure I could travel 50 or so miles and find one that would take my wad of trash in all of its unadulterated glory. In the grand scheme of things, a 50 mile drive actually isn't all that bad. It's inefficient for sure, and I'm not big on rampant inefficiency, but that's manageable since I would only be doing it every few months. But once I get there, I still have to pay for it, and on top of that, I'm dumping it straight from the box to their facilities, meaning some garbage guys and gals are going to be all up in my house. Like I've said before, I don't mind <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5743114304094208">people seeing my situation</a>, but I'd prefer not baring all to some complete strangers. Finally, I still have the aforementioned problem of building up trash for weeks or months at a time, an all-you-can-eat buffet for pests. Certainly not ideal.</p>
<h3>Just toss it somewhere?</h3>
<p>Definitely not. Aside from being straight up illegal to dump your trash in unauthorized dumpsters, it's also just incredibly rude and not my thing. I'm not trying to be the homeless guy creeping around foreign apartment complexes looking for a place to dump my trash under the cover of night. That's beyond weird. I'm also not going to ask my friends if I can dump my discards in their trash, because that's just as strange. In the same vein, it's also not their responsibility in the slightest. I'm the one who signed up to live in a truck, they shouldn't be responsible for any of the side effects or consequences.</p>
<h3>Moderation.</h3>
<p>The more I thought about it, the more I realized the main issue was one of quantity. It's easy to throw away a piece of trash, you just toss it in one of the million receptacles blending into the background of your day-to-day activities. If you let it accumulate though, it quickly becomes a cumbersome blob, an entity all its own. So the solution I went with was a simple one: buy some small, biodegradable trash bags, and every time you generate trash, throw it in one of those bags, then toss it out the next time you're out and about. Tossing a small bag into a public trash can isn't a burden to anyone, and it saves me from building a trash stockpile in the same place I sleep. Combine this with the above practices for minimizing trash in the first place, and you have a reasonable, low-cost, sustainable system. I've found that I only really generate trash one or two nights a week now that I'm all settled in, and it's usually just a tissue or old cloth while cleaning or exterminating the occasional bug who wanders into my crosshairs.</p>
<p>So that's that. Take a little bit of planning, add some small bags, develop a process that takes up no more than 2 minutes and you have a solid recipe for keeping your truck home free of trash.</p>

<p><sub><em>First of all, apologies for the lack of updates over the past few weeks, I've been busy with a product launch and doing a bit of work-related travel, so I haven't had a chance to sit down and polish off any of posts. However, things are starting to settle down, and I have a bunch of new posts in the pipeline at various levels of readiness, so watch for those over the coming week.</em></sub></p>
<p>I did a bit of traveling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States">back east</a> last week, first to give a tech talk at my <a href="http://umass.edu">alma mater</a>, and then to work out of the Boston branch of my company. Aside from the general allure of travel and visiting other offices, there was also something particularly interesting about this trip for me: I got to experience a work routine much closer to what everyone else in the working world experiences. For the first day of my trip, I stayed in a hotel near UMass, but opted to stay at a (hospitable) friend's house on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Shore_(Massachusetts)">South Shore</a> while working in Boston. No trucks, no showering at a gym, just a normal house and a normal commute to work.</p>
<h2>The Commute</h2>
<p>I've definitely mentioned my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5741031244955648">distain</a> for <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5651442522128384">traffic</a> before; nothing rubs me quite as wrong as a couple thousand cars idling unnecessarily and wasting time that could otherwise be spend on less menial, mindless, monotonous tasks. Truck life allows me to avoid this for the most part, I live walking distance from work, and my normal "commute" doesn't even touch real roads, it's an assortment of trails and pedestrian areas.</p>
<h3>The First Day</h3>
<p>Leaving UMass for Boston at 10 am on a Wednesday morning was a great call. I had a zippy (but otherwise unnoteworthy) trip down the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Turnpike">Mass Pike</a>, steering wheel in one hand and some sorely missed <a href="https://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html">Dunkin' Donuts</a> coffee in the other. Unfortunately, my good fortune didn't extend to my commute home, because in spite of my contempt for traffic, my travel plans had me leaving the office at exactly the worst possible time. I was placed at the pinnacle of Boston rush hour traffic and left at the mercy of the angry, burnt out commuters around me. Two and a half hours into what should have been an hour long commute, I made it home.</p>
<h3>The Rest of the Week</h3>
<p>After the horror show otherwise known as my commute home, I opted to take the train in for the rest of the week. I figured a 20 minute drive followed by a 45 minute train ride would be much less painful, especially because it's 45 minutes I don't have to spend behind the wheel. But alas, like the majority of things I think will work out, it wasn't nearly as smooth as I'd hoped. First, I went to a train station that had a closed down parking garage, then I proceeded to draw imaginary knots in the road trying to find the garage at the next train station. Eventually I parked, and proceeded to spend the next 45 minutes awkwardly bumping into strangers on the train because I clearly haven't earned my sea legs yet. After work, the train ride back was a similar game of body bumper cars, though this time I got to top it off by sitting in 20 minutes of traffic before I even escaped the parking garage. Wonderful.</p>
<h2>So, how's it compare?</h2>
<p>Clearly the commuting part of my day was not as buttery smooth as I had hoped, but it was far from the worst thing that's ever happened to someone, and millions of people perform similar commutes every day without complaint. Like anything else in life, I'm sure it's something <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5659645909663744">you get used to</a>. Plus, I had a ton of fun working out of the Boston office, so it was totally worth it. Other things being equal, my truck commute wins hands down. I can wake up in both places at 5:30 am and be at work at 8 am, fact. The difference is that when I wake up in the truck, I spend the 2.5 intervening hours exercising and pumping myself up for the day, whereas if I commute, those same 2.5 hours are spent basting myself in exhaust fumes and the sweat of fellow train-goers.</p>
<p>Obviously there are trade-offs here, and pretty much every other post will discuss the pros and cons of living in of a truck. My only point here, if there really even is one, is that the truck facilitates a stress-free, uneventful commute. And when I'm expected to do that five days a week for (more or less) the rest of my life, it's a pretty dramatic improvement to the quality of my life.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Human beings didn't become the dominant lifeforms on the planet by being rigid and inflexible in the face of change. We're able to adapt, when we receive similar stimuli over and over again, we react to it more and more efficiently and effectively each time. Naturally, these stimuli come in an endless procession, in innumerable forms. On a physical, nearly tangible level, repeated stresses on our bodies build muscle mass so that we're better equipped to handle these stresses in the future. Biologically, our bodies learn to handle repeated threats by developing antigens after the first encounter. Socially, we modify our habits to fit in with our habitats. When we uproot our lives and move to other locations we learn local customs over time, and our interactions with our environment become more fluid over time. My situation is no different, and I'm definitely noticing the ways I've adjusted, both consciously and unconsciously, to <em>my</em> environment.</p>
<p>I noticed it earlier tonight, while I was getting ready for bed. I threw open the back gate of the truck, a now-familiar cacophony that I've come to associate with home. I tossed my gym bag in first with a loud thud and some clanging, and then I hopped in. As has become ritual, I started flipping through the music catalog on my phone looking for an accompaniment to my routine. Once I found something good, I plopped the phone onto my bed and started unpacking and re-packing my bag. I pulled off all my work clothes, dumped them into my laundry bag, and put on some pajamas. I'm presently laying in bed, listening to the playlist I picked out, and writing this post.</p>
<p>Now contrast that with <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5639274879778816">my first night</a>. It's only been three months, but it turns out acclimating to a new routine happens pretty quickly. The body craves consistency, and is definitely much more comfortable when it doesn't have to work too hard to maintain homeostasis. On my first night, I was a nervous wreck. The whole evening leading up to it was torturous. I was still grappling with the idea of not having a fixed home, full of concerns about my relatively unknown environment, and futilely trying to process the constant information overload. When I was within sight of the truck, I became paranoid and uncomfortable, my eyes darting around like everyone was onto me. I scurried across the lot with my heart racing at a hundred miles a minute, and I didn't even start unlocking the back gate until I had convinced myself I was the only person in a 10 mile radius. Similarly, opening the back gate happened at a slower pace than tectonic plate movement, and I winced at each and every loud, unavoidable creak. Once inside, I crept around like a field mouse, and listened intently to the silence of the surrounding area for minutes before I even considered getting undressed. My whole routine for getting ready was awkward and inefficient, tip-toeing back and forth, treating the squeaky floorboards like landmines. It took more than twice as long as it does now, and was just all around not well-tuned for the situation.</p>
<p>But that's the power of adaptation. It doesn't even require a concerted effort on the part of the adapter, sometimes the driving force is just a subconscious desire for a better plan of action. It's a powerful tool against all shades of strife and adversity, a weapon so graciously bestowed upon humankind by a few billion years of fighting against our environments. It's certainly a reassuring thought, at least for me, that time is all it takes.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I knew the day would come eventually. In <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5668600916475904">one of my first posts</a>, I mentioned a guy who was doing something similar to what I'm doing now. His observation was that security personnel at these large companies doesn't care how insane you are if you work at the company and aren't hurting anyone. Last night, I had my first run in with company security. What follows is my experience.</p>
<p>It's almost 1 am, I just got out of a movie with a few friends. The movie was mediocre at best, certainly nothing special. I drive my house back to my usual parking place at the edge of a company lot, as I normally do. I grab my bag of toiletries and head into a nearby building to brush my teeth and wash my face. As I walk out, I pass a security car. They linger for a minute, and then drive off. I don't think much of it. After a short traipse across the lot, I hop into my car, put on my pajamas, and go to sleep.</p>
<p><em>Knock. Knock. Knock. Is there anyone in there?</em></p>
<p>It's 2 am, and I'm pretty disoriented. I try to compose myself and quietly reply, "Yes, one second." After stumbling around in the dark for a few seconds, I find a sweatshirt and throw it on. Opening up the back gate and going outside, I'm greeted by approximately 10 security personnel, pointing flashlights in various directions, standing by a variety of security vehicles. They explain to me that one of them saw me get into the back of the car, and when they ran my plate against the company database, the information didn't match up. Apparently I'd registered the car as a Chevrolet Econoline in the company's internal system, when in reality it was a Ford.* I offer to move my truck, but they tell me I'm fine, and even that I have a "sweet setup". I hand one of them my corporate badge and make weird truck-related small talk with the rest as they confirm with the security dispatcher that I am indeed an employee. It felt like an eternity, but the whole interaction took place over the course of less than 5 minutes. They tell me to have a nice night, and even apologize for waking me up.</p>
<p>After explaining the situation to a friend they were "glad the interaction with security has happened, went well and [is] over," a sentiment I share. Like I said, it was inevitable, and I'm actually pretty surprised that it took three months to happen. But now that I know for sure I'm not being banished or shunned at a corporate level for my truck lifestyle, I can rest that much easier.</p>
<p>*<sub><em>I checked after and they were totally right, my bad. "Chevrolet Econoline" isn't even a real vehicle.</em></sub></p>
<p><sub><em>Note: I wrote most of this post immediately after it happened. Like, literally as the cars were driving away at 2 am.</em></sub></p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>...or at least drive Class B vehicles. Also, as it turns out, licenses have a lot of personal information on them, and I've done my darnedest to remove any fun details, like where I "live".</p>
<p>Anyways, I've finally done it. For those who don't understand why this is exciting for me, let me give you a bit of background.</p>
<h2>The Backstory</h2>
<p>I drove buses in college. It was the highest-paying job on campus, which is what initially drew me towards it. But it was the flexibility, fun coworkers, and quick promotion to programmer that kept me there. The deal was that they'd pay you while training you to get your CDL license, and in return you'd drive for them for a few semesters at the very least, which as I mentioned in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5673385510043648">this post</a>, is a pretty sweet deal. So I did my shtick driving buses and writing code for them for four years while I pursued higher education. Overall it was a good time, I definitely recommend it.</p>
<h2>Onwards, to Cali</h2>
<p>So I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5707702298738688">graduated</a> and decided to try out this coast out for a while. One of the first things I did (after buying the box truck, of course) was  make my way down to the DMV and get a license like a real-life California resident. I would have been fine with a normal, Class C license. After all, my career out here is software engineering, not bus driving. But a consequence of getting a normal license, because of various laws and whatnot, was that the DMV would have to shred and invalidate my out-of-state Class B license. This, I was not fine with. I felt that I had worked hard and earned the right to drive stupidly large vehicles, why should moving across the country deprive me of that? So I started looking into the process to transfer my CDL license to a California CDL license.</p>
<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>After a bit of inquiry, I found out that the process would be approximately two steps. The first: pass a series of tests on how to <em>not</em> crash large, occasionally fast-moving vehicles. The second: prove to a certified doctor that you probably won't fall asleep/die/seize/go blind/spontaneously combust while piloting aforementioned vehicles. Easy peasy. I aced the tests on my <del><a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5673385510043648">first</a></del> second try. I found a local person who claimed to be a doctor and allowed them to examine me. They seemed confident I was fit to commandeer 13+ ton pieces of machinery, and if they're cool with it, I'm cool with it.</p>
<h2>Roadblocks</h2>
<p>With all of my completed paperwork in hand, I drudged my way back to the DMV and patiently waited in line for the better part of eternity. Once it was my turn, I approached the pearly gates and handed them my papers, and they spoke thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, there's been a computer error, you'll have to come back next week.</p>
<p><em>-DMV Employee/Keeper of the Pearly Gates</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was devastating to me for a few reasons. Firstly, this process had really been dragging on, it had been almost three months since my first DMV visit (with four more in the middle), and I was really hoping this would be the last one. The second, and most nerve-racking reason, was that I didn't know what was causing the computer error. What made my application different than all of the others? Was it because I didn't have a real address? Was the DMV about to accidentally stumble onto the fact that I'm secretly homeless and the <strong>home</strong> address I've provided them with is nothing more than a storefront. After all, it doesn't take more than a Google search of the address to see that it's a glorified post office box, could they have a system that does the same thing? This was moderately stressful, I was sure that I was all set and then this roadblock popped up. A soul-crushing experience all-around.</p>
<h2>The Return Trip</h2>
<p>So I made another trip to the DMV a few days later. If you're a fan of the sound of small children crying, or particularly enjoy the scents of bad hygiene and <a href="http://www.bmc.org/thoracicsurgery/diseasesandconditions-hyperhidrosis.htm">hyperhidrosis</a>, then you would have had a blast at this DMV outing. I, like most people, am not a fan of those things, and thus I did not enjoy this DMV trip. In any case, I went back up, explained my story, and they called some people who hopefully had a better grasp on the situation. After a few more eternities, they asked for my old license, and in return handed me a small piece of paper with the title "TEMPORARY LICENSE".</p>
<p>This was a start, but I was still on edge, and wouldn't be entirely comfortable until I had the full-blown, big boy license, which they said should arrive in the mail in the next 60 days. In my haste and anxiousness, I didn't realize the implications of handing in my only photo ID. What this meant was that the ensuing few weeks were to be devoid of any bar-visits on my behalf, tragic I know. But as is evident from the picture above, it did eventually arrive in the mail, adding legitimacy to both my truck ownership, and my sketchy private mail box address. If there's any takeaway from this story, it's that the DMV can be a fickle mistress, but things normally work themselves out in the end.</p>
<p>A terrible takeaway I know, but unfortunately my hours of pondering life's unanswered questions while waiting at the DMV didn't yield any earth-shattering revelations.</p>

<p>One problem that you wouldn't expect to have in a truck is losing things. It's a single, small, essentially square room. There are no doors, closets, nooks, crannies, trap doors, false floors, drop ceilings, or hiding places to speak of. Everything should be well accounted for. In spite of this, I've managed to lose the following items, most of which I acquired on my first trip to <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5649050225344512">Home Depot</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Switchblade</li>
<li>Screwdriver</li>
<li>Roll of Tape</li>
<li>Nail Clippers</li>
<li>Batteries</li>
</ul>
<p>I've spent an obscene amount of time racking my brain over where these things could have possibly gone, checking every crevice and corner and drawer (all four of them). Nothing within the realm of logic and reason can produce an explanation as to what has happened to my various belongs. It's not like they all vanished at once either. They're being picked off one by one, like they're all characters in a horror movie, being tormented by a killer of inanimate objects. Naturally I don't notice their absence until I need them, the perfectly inopportune time.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, I'm just misplacing them or throwing them away by accident or eating them in my sleep, but I'm much more fond of the idea that someone is playing an incredibly elaborate prank on me. It's not like anything missing is particularly expensive (not that I have anything of value in there), so it's not particularly worrisome to me. What will disappear next? Will I ever solve the puzzle? Is my truck eating my other belongings out of jealous? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8NniKYiy2I">The world may never know.</a></p>

<p>Gnat nightmares, spider sadness, moth madness, ant anxiety, bug barrage&#8212;ok I'll stop now.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of bugs. Generally speaking, unless you're an entomologist or earthy-crunchy type, you probably aren't either. I'm not terrified of them by any means, I'm not liable to stop what I'm doing if a bug decides to drop by and say hey, but I'm still likely to exterminate them all with extreme prejudice before going to sleep. After all, nobody is trying to <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-people-swallow-8-spiders-a-year-while-they-sleep1/">eat spiders whilst slumbering</a>. I'm happy to say that I haven't had any full-blown infestations <em>recently</em>, though it hasn't always been the case.</p>
<p>Before I recount in gritty detail the various hordes who've ravaged my home, I should note that the box makes a fantastic breeding ground for all of my nightmares. It's warm, dark, and humid during the day, and I keep the back gate slightly open at night for air circulation and temperature control, so it's even easily accessible for them. On top of that, despite <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5643440998055936">not keeping any food in there</a>, there are more than enough yummy goodies (from an insect's perspective) in the form of cloth, wood, and the various clumps of refuse hiding in cracks and crevices left behind by previous truckers. Basically, I'd been inadvertently building a 128 ft<sup>2</sup> insect farm and microbiome from the start.</p>
<h2>Moths</h2>
<p>Moths were the first plague I encountered. I'm not sure what drew them in initially, but I started noticing them a few days after I "moved in". As it turns out, moths feed on fabric, particularly wool and silk, which I apparently have in my wardrobe (who would have thought). For about a week, it was a pretty common occurrence to have 3 or 4 flying around when I came back, and it really bothered me when they'd fly out of my gym bag at work, or I'd find them dead at the bottom of the dryer (I'm currently shuddering thinking about the latter two). I think the issue is mainly that my clothes (on a rack) are too easily accessible, clothes left in the attic of a normal home have similar issues. Anyway, I went on a pretty intense extermination spree, shaking out all my clothes and washing my entire wardrobe, and that seemed to do the trick. Now I periodically beat all my clothes with a broomstick, like a normal, well-adjusted human being. And when I'm packing the next-day's clothes into my gym bag, I always shake them out first to double check. I still have the odd run-in with moths, but now it's more like one per week, which is, in my opinion, very manageable.</p>
<h2>Spiders</h2>
<p>If you had never seen a spider before, and nobody had explained to you that spiders existed, it'd be very reasonable to believe that they were straight up malicious alien lifeforms. They're hairy, have legs coming out radially all over the place, have crazy eyes, and they make these intricate webs exclusively for trapping (and subsequently <strong>eating alive</strong>) prey and pissing people off. They're weird and scary, and in the harsh lighting of my truck, they cast massive, nightmarish shadows, regardless of their actual size. On top of that, their presence normally means there are other pests for them to feed on, so their very existence spells trouble. For all these reasons, I have quite the preoccupation with keeping them away from me. I've never found more than one or two at a time, but I'm much more comfortable when there are zero of them. Controlling them normally means controlling whatever else has inhabited the box first, then killing all the leftover spiders by hunting them down one by one. Finding all their sneaky hiding spots can be tricky, but it's not that bad when your entire house is one room.</p>
<h2>Ants</h2>
<p>My ant infestation was by far the worst experience I had. Originally, I noticed a few small, translucent insects crawling over the wood securement I use to hold the bed in place. No big deal I thought, I'll just move the wood to near the door and brush them off outside with the broom. But when I moved the wood, I saw that there were a ton more of them, and it wasn't the wood that they were after. In fact, hordes of them were moving back and forth from a shadowed corner of the truck. This is essentially what nightmares are made of, an uncountable number of entities moving in the shadows. I immediately moved my bed to the other side of the truck, and hesitantly shined a flashlight into the shadowy corner. It was as awful as I could have imagined. I was greeted by an army of tiny, determined ants, pouring endlessly out of a small crack in the wall. I spent the next two hours sweeping them out of the truck, neurotically checking and scrubbing every corner of the truck. Once I felt I had it under control, I went to sleep, only to be haunted by wave after wave of insect-related nightmares. As you can imagine, the next day saw a hasty trip to none other than <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5649050225344512">Home Depot</a>.</p>
<p> The tricky thing about killing insects in the truck is that you can't outright spray them with chemicals or put mothballs everywhere: it's a small, enclosed, poorly-ventilated area, and spraying a pesticide cocktail in the place where I sleep is pretty much a guarantee that my kids will be born with the wrong number of eyes and limbs. Luckily, I found <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Terro-Liquid-Ant-Killer-Bait-Stations-6-Pack-T300/202532940">these</a> perfectly-evil ant traps, which work by being delicious to ants, and then killing them after they've already fed the entire colony. I dropped one of those bad boys near the aforementioned crack of despair, and then didn't look at it for two days. When I went to check in, the transparent plastic container was filled with the stationary bodies of my enemies, which brought me a palpable sense of relief (and joy?). I threw that trap out, and put another one down. At present, that second trap has been down for three weeks, and I haven't seen a single ant in or around the truck since. Powerful stuff.</p>

<em>Source: <span>I never actually saw the couch, so I don't know what it looks like, but this is from the one and only <a href="http://www.ikea.com">Ikea</a></span></em>
</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Every once in a while, life will challenge you with a question. Not only does this question require an answer, but regardless of the choice you make, you know that it will have a profound impact on your life. Thankfully, it is infrequently that we are burdened with such decisions, but we must still be vigilant so that we may ponder and puzzle and appropriately pick a plan when the need arises. Recently, one of these decisions was thrust upon my shoulders, and it came to me in the following form:</p>
<p><em>Hey Brandon, would you like a couch? A friend of mine has a new one they don't need anymore.</em></p>
<p>Ok, maybe I was being a bit dramatic initially, but I've learned that living in a truck changes where your priorities lie. For example, if I lived in an apartment, chances are I would have simply said yes. A free, new piece of furniture for my (likely) sparingly furnished (imaginary) apartment would be a nice addition. It's especially hard to argue with the free part. However, I don't live in an apartment, so there were some considerations to be had. So, as I am one to do in the face of adversity, I made a list of pros and cons.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>I'd been considering getting a couch even before one was offered to me on a silver platter. These are the reasons why I was even thinking about it in the first place.<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sprucing up the place.</strong> As evident from <a href="http://thoughts.frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5704837555552256">this post</a>, I still have a <em>ton</em> of free space, my truck is a pretty spartan affair. Adding a new piece of furniture could add some Feng Shui to the whole situation.</li>
<li><strong>Chill space. </strong> I'm not in the truck frequently, and I especially don't have people over frequently. That said, it does <a href="http://thoughts.frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5631943370604544">sometimes happen</a>, and I'd like it to be a pleasant experience when it does. A couch would make it easier for a couple friends to come over and hang out. Or I could always come to them with my chill pad, that's a weird perk.</li>
<li><strong>It's just more homey. </strong> This is in line with the above points. People are always telling me that the truck doesn't look particularly welcoming. Naturally, that's not the goal, the goal is to have a comfortable place to sleep. Adding in a couch would definitely help to diffuse the "unwelcoming vibes".</li>
<li><strong>Free! </strong> It doesn't cost anything! You really can't beat just being handed a free, new couch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Sounds pretty good, right? What sort of drawbacks could there possibly be? As it turns out, putting the couch in a truck changes the equation a little bit.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free?</strong> In a house, the couch would be free. In a truck, I pay for the cost of the couch in reduced gas mileage. As it turns out, I have to drive everything I own around every time I pull out of a parking spot. I don't drive around all that much, as I've undoubtedly mentioned before, but I'm still toting around my bed and bureau every time I do, which is less efficient than if I didn't own those things. How much less efficient, you ask? Well, looking at <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/22/">this comic</a>, which references <a href="http://priuschat.com/threads/heavy-weight-drivers-effecting-mpg.41923/#ixzz2Chj07sVA">this conversation</a>, which (finally) links to <a href="http://privatenrg.com/">this tool</a>, it looks like a car takes about a <strong>0.5% hit to fuel economy</strong> for every 50 pounds added to it. Time to make some assumptions. Let's assume that I get 10 miles per gallon, gas costs $3.50, and the sofa bed weighs 150 pounds (<a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80301462/">thanks Ikea</a>). Since we're adding 50 pounds three times over (150/50 = 3), that means we're taking the 0.5% hit three times, which means we're operating at ~98.5% efficiency (100*0.995<sup>3</sup>). So if I were to drive 1,000 miles, without the couch I'd use 100 gallons of gas. With the couch, I'd use 101.5 gallons. Wait a second, that's not even that much worse, that's like $5 extra for every 1,000 miles I drive. I expected it to actually be a lot, my bad.</li>
<li><strong>Empty space, for now.</strong> I mentioned above that I have tons of free space, and that's entirely true. However, I don't know how my needs are going to change in the future, and adding a couch does take away like ~15% of the free space that I do have. It's good to keep the extra space, if for no other reason than to be flexible.</li>
<li><strong>Bug food.</strong> I'll eventually dedicate a whole post to this, but in essence: there are enough diverse species of bugs around that there is at least one genetically-engineered to be an eating machine for each and every material in existence. This especially includes cloth, which there will undoubtedly be a ton of in a couch. The last thing I want is a micro-ecosystem thriving in the depths of my couch.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the sudden realization that owning the couch costs me like $5 every 1,000 miles, I'm <em>almost</em> regretting not getting it, because that was my biggest concern. Oh well, you live and you learn.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I enjoy living in a truck. It's simple and efficient, it's a choice I made and intend to stand by. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm proud of living a truck, but I certainly don't have a problem telling people about it (as evident by the fact that this blog exists). When I meet new people, it normally comes up as a matter of course, and I'm more than happy to talk about it and all the quirky things that come with it. That said, this installment of Tips from the Truck is concerned with knowing when truck talk is not appropriate, namely in the workplace.</p>
<p>Very few (read: two) of my coworkers know that I live in a truck. For the most part, if housing comes up in discussion, as far as they're concerned I live in a small apartment in a nondescript part of the Bay Area. I don't encourage lying to your coworkers as part of a healthy daily regimen of deceit, but my argument here is this: These people are colleagues and coworkers first and foremost, I'm interacting with them on a daily basis exchanging ideas and sending code back and forth. For that to work smoothly and efficiently, my workplace peers need to see me as a competent, contributing member of the team who they feel comfortable collaborating with. Being the dude who lives out back like some sort of trailer park reject <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver">MacGyver-ing</a> the workplace to suit his needs is not a great way to foster teamwork and cooperation. I'm sure they'd be more than accepting of the situation if I explained it to them; the vast majority of people I talk to about it are very receptive and understanding, but I'd hate for a personal detail to poison any coworker relationships in the event someone didn't approve. So, now that we know there's a ruse to uphold, how do we keep with it, without expending too much effort?</p>
<p>I've said in the past that if you're going to live in a truck, hygiene needs to be a <strong>top</strong> priority. Seriously. This means having floss, deodorant, toothpaste, a razor, and Q-tips<sup>&#174;</sup> in your gym bag on a daily basis, <strong>and using them</strong>. No skimping: gym, shower, shave, and get ready for the day, everyday, without fail. You need to go into work looking clean and well-composed, not aloof and sloppy (this is just generally good advice). This also means doing laundry as frequently as necessary to make sure you're never wearing dirty clothes (again, generally reasonable). Being in Silicon Valley and an engineer means you probably don't have a dress code at work (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/24/hp_dress_code/">unless you're at HP</a>), but you should still try to wear a collared shirt every now and then.</p>
<p>This poses another problem though, because what's the point of wearing a collared shirt if it's going to be wrinkled and unsightly. After all, you live in a truck and I hope you don't have an iron in there, that seems like a bad idea. But you still want to have fresh, wrinkle-free clothes, right? My strategy for this has been to use fabric softener and "wrinkle-free" dry cycles, and then watch the dryer like a paranoid hawk, grabbing and folding the clothes before they cool down all wrinkled and unpleasant-looking. Once you get back to your truck, hang up all your dress shirts if you have the room.*</p>
<p>One final tip: seeing as you don't have running water, it can be tricky to clean things like shoes and water bottles. For my shoes, I like to take a damp, post-shower towel and run it around the outsole a few times a week to keep them fresh-looking, and I wash out my water bottle in the office kitchen.</p>
<p>Easy peasy, lemon squeezy! You're a prim and proper pickup truck plutocrat. Now go out into the real world smelling fresh and looking way less crazy than you actually are.</p>
<sup><em>*Note: This may cause issues with moths. I will attempt to address clothing storage and insect control in future posts.</em></sup>

<p>Traffic is a strange beast. Sometimes it comes from nowhere at all, wreaking unspeakable havoc on your itinerary, eviscerating your plans with startling efficiency. Other times it's entirely expected, and entirely unavoidable. In any case, nobody particular enjoys traffic (I certainly don't), it's an environmental tragedy, and it's ruthlessly wasteful. By all accounts, traffic is a Bad Thing<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<p>Call it schadenfreude if you want, but on days when I'm not up at the crack of dawn, there's nothing I love more than rolling out of bed at my leisure, lazing my way to the gym, hopping on a treadmill and watching the brutal commute thousands and thousands of people are enduring. It's especially glorious because a large percentage of these people are, at a snail's pace, traveling to exactly where I already am. And it only took me 5 minutes to get here. My co-worker came in today exhausted because commuting from his house, a 15 minute stroll not during rush hours, took him a whopping <strong>hour and a half</strong> this morning, for no reason in particular. It's especially tragic because he still has a commute home to look forward to, which will undoubtedly be plagued by the same atrocities. I don't have the constitution or resolve to handle such a soul-crushing experience on a twice-daily basis, but power to everyone who does.</p>
<p>Living close to (read: at) work is certainly nice, especially under the lens of traffic, but don't get me wrong, it does indeed have its downsides, and I'd be lying if I said it was all sunshine and roses. For one, living at work makes it really easy to have a bad work/life balance, especially on weekends. If I'm not keeping busy enough, it's tempting to just go into work and get some stuff done, maybe do some laundry and hang out for a bit. I find that because I don't have a living room to hang out in, I have to keep reminding myself to get out and constantly have activities planned. All things considered though, I think the grueling commute is what burns a lot of people out, and the time and energy and resources I save by not having to endure that play a huge role in keeping me happy and productive <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5689792285114368">as I work towards my larger goals.</a></p>

<p>As a forewarning, this post doesn't <sup>really</sup> provide tips on how to be invisible, it's more of an observation of human nature.</p>
<p>One of my biggest stressors when I was considering living in a van, as is undoubtedly evident from my earlier posts, was my unshakable fear that I was going to be caught, arrested, or otherwise reprimanded. I was worried that I wouldn't be discreet enough, or I'd make some grave mistake one day, or anything but a perfectly executed ninja-esque routine would spell my end. One too many loud creaks at night, not closing the back gate quietly enough, climbing out at the exact wrong time, parking in the wrong place, etc, the ways I could screw things up seemed limitless. But a fortuitous combination of rote observation and apparent realization led me to the following declaration:</p>
<h2>The Realization</h2>
<p>The realization that I had was that the vast majority of bad things that could happen to me required another person. Someone to see (and subsequently report) me, someone to tell me I needed to leave, someone to be so taken aback by my (in my opinion, untheatrical) actions that they saw it entirely necessary to go out of their way and see that something is done about it, etc, nothing truly bad could happen to me without a definitive, intentional action from another human being. Understanding this, my very survival (as a box-truck inhabitant), hinged on one of the two following things being true:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nobody ever seeing me</li>
or
<li>Nobody feeling inclined to interfere</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Observation</h2>
<p>If one of those two above-mentioned things were to be true, everything might just work out.</p>
<h3>Nobody Ever Seeing Me</h3>
<p>If nobody ever sees me, nobody can really intentionally act against me, right? This case falls in line with my initial musings, that if I'm invisible, I'll be fine. If I can ensure that no single human being ever sees me entering, being in, or exiting the box truck, and that nobody ever questions its existence, and the moon and stars align, I might just make it out squeaky clean: a smooth, friction-less experience. However, that seems extremely unlikely. I can do my best to minimize contact with other human beings: I can leave early in the morning and come back late at night, I can take careful, quiet, deliberate footsteps, I can open and close the noisy back gate slowly and tenderly, etc. There are a million things I can do to make myself as invisible as possible, but regardless of how sneaky I am, at the end of the day, I can't control all the factors, or chance for that matter. Even if I listen super carefully before leaving the truck, there could still be someone parked right next to me, watching me get out of my truck. Or maybe a security car rolls by right as I'm hoping in. Or maybe a family on vacation bizarrely takes photographs for ten minutes with me and my half-open tailgate in the not-so-distant background. As you may have guessed, all these things have happened. They're just a product of random chance, and regardless of how careful and calculating I am, they're going to continue to happen.</p>
<p>So if it's impossible to stop people from seeing me, I guess I'll just have to hope that nobody steps in, right? Here's where I start making some useful observations.</p>
<h3>Nobody Feeling Inclined to Interfere</h3>
<p>Like I said above, I have random run-ins all the time. People may not understand what I'm doing or what's going on, but I'm definitely noticed by strangers on a daily basis as I go about my mundane truck routine. So, knowing that, how do I manage to not get caught, or arrested, or whatever else I was worried would happen to me? I'll tell you how. It's because <em>nobody cares</em>. I'm going to say that again, because it's super important:</p>
<p><strong><em>Nobody cares.</em></strong></p>
<p>These are other human beings who are going about their own lives, with their own preoccupations, their own responsibilities, their own concerns. My life's brief collision with theirs barely even registers as an event in their lives, in most cases it doesn't even warrant conscious thought. I'm as relevant to their life as a traffic light, and that's a good thing. They have their own stack of worries to mull over, what motivation do they have to exert a non-negligible energy to disrupt my life. Humans are a lot like the electrons I spent so much of college learning about, in most cases, we're perfectly happy taking the path of least resistance. And in the case of fleeting interactions with random strangers, the path of least resistance is to do nothing at all.</p>
<p>And that's why I'm completely fine. Not because I'm a perfect master of stealth, but because people can't be bothered. At best, they've immediately replaced the experience of seeing me with much more real, pressing issues in their lives, and at worst, I've become a bit of conversation-fodder for a dinner table discussion that night. In both extrema, I'm soon forgotten and nobody is mounting an offensive against me or my lifestyle, and that's exactly why I sleep so soundly at night.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5639274879778816">this post</a>, I mention that, upon my arrival, there were already several other vehicles that looked like they could be home to serial killers, the mentally-insane, or otherwise psychologically degenerate human beings. Some of the vehicles, namely a truck and a few RVs, move around occasionally, a sure sign of life. Others, like the hippie van pictured above on the far right, have not moved in the two months I've been here. However, despite these clear signs of organic life, I had never actually encountered any other people who were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p47fEXGabaY">Livin' La Vida Loca</a>(motive).</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>That is, until last week.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Allow me to set the scene, as I sometimes do. It's a Monday night, nearly indistinguishable from most others. If anything were to set it apart, it'd be my general tardiness in getting back to the box. It's about 10 PM at this point, well-beyond sunset, a deviance from my normal 9 PM arrival. I've just finished washing up and biking back to my home, and I'm walking across the parking lot when I see someone get out of the truck pictured above, center. I can hardly contain my excitement, after all, I'm finally making contact, a flesh and bone confirmation that I'm not alone in my endeavors. My change in pace or direction must have come to their attention, because they immediately started looking around nervously, which makes sense; they didn't know what my intentions were. I introduce myself, and let him know that I'm the occupant of the truck next door, which naturally brings him relief. Among all of the possible reasons someone would approach you in a parking lot, "wanting to meet the neighbors" is probably the best one.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of a language barrier, but from what I gathered, he had driven here from a few states over in his truck. Once he got out here, he hopped on <a href="craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> and found a camper for around $1,000, which is definitely an interesting (and even more frugal) approach. He's only interning here, so his arrangement is more temporary. I gave him a brief tour of my dwelling, which he commended on its spacious, open floor plan. We spoke for a few minutes about the various difficulties we've come across and where we park and other normal truck-person conversation, then we parted ways.</p>
<p>So there it is. I've officially met my first real-life neighbor. In the week since, I've run into him a few times walking to and from the box, and even once out on the road. If nothing else, it's nice having some tangible proof that even if I am insane, I'm not the only one.</p>

<p>A big part of truck life is managing the limited amount of space you have available to you. Depending on what sort of vehicle you're living in, you may have more or less space available to you, but generally, unless you live in a full on tractor trailer, you're going to have less than 200 ft<sup>2</sup> of space, so you need to be smart about how and where you keep your belongings. As you can see from the picture above, I was able to increase the overall contiguous space available to me (useful, for example, for a <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5631943370604544">truckwarming party</a>).</p>
<p>Efficiently rearranging your living situation requires a little bit of forethought. For me, the following process worked really well:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make a list.</strong> Check it twice, find out who's naughty and who's nice. Just kidding. But you do want to make a list of all the large objects you have in your truck. Generally, this list will include anything stationary (beds, storage, furniture, etc), and anything that takes up a reasonable amount of space, even if it can be moved around pretty easily (like a broom or suitcase, for example). For me, the list included my bed, dresser, and coat rack, as well as a small box of tools.</li>
<li><strong>Measure everything.</strong> Once you've made your list, measure the length and width of each item on it, and write these dimensions down on your list. Then measure the dimensions of the overall living space. I just looked up the dimensions for the twin bed and the Ikea dresser I built (<a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5676830073815040">detailed here</a>), and measured the depth and length of the coat rack (<a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5757334940811264">build detailed here</a>).  I also looked up the dimensions of the box to confirm my rough measurements.</li>
<li><strong>Sketch it out.</strong> Now that you know everything you need to place, and the space you have to place it, start figuring out arrangements that make sense. My strategy was to put everything at the back, leaving all of the open space in the front. Since I was trying to maximize the amount of free space I had, I decided to put the bed sideways across the truck, leaving enough room for my box of tools at the foot of the bed. It made sense to move the coat rack there too, because that way, accelerating and braking wouldn't cause my clothes to move all over the place, and it meant I could put in a larger rack. Make sure to take into consideration the extra space you'll need for opening and closing drawers, hanging clothes, and just maneuvering around in general. As for the actual sketching part, you can use a normal piece of graph paper, or make a diagram online, like the one I made and included above.</li>
<li><strong>Start shuffling things around.</strong> Now that you've planned it out, get to moving! Remove all securements you may have built to keep everything safe, and play your own truck-sized version of <a href="http://tetris.com/">Tetris</a>. You might want to make sure it won't be too hot out on the day you plan on moving: hard labor in a hot box is far from the most pleasant of experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Secure it back down.</strong> As detailed in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5697982787747840">my previous Tips from the Truck post</a>, you'll want to make sure to properly re-secure everything once you're satisfied with the new arrangement. Maybe take a lap around the block as a trial run before you resume your normal driving.</li>
</ol>
<p>And voila! Enjoy your new and improved, more spacious, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui">Feng shui</a> living arrangements.</p>

<p><em>I've [redacted] people's faces from the photo*, both because of the questionable legality of hanging out and drinking in a truck, and for their own privacy.</em></p>
<p>As you may remember from <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5709068098338816">this Q &amp; A session</a> I mentioned that a truckwarming party was in the works. Some planning, a little food, a few  drinks, and a week of time were enough to bring the idea to fruition.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of living in a truck is that you can have your truckwarming party wherever you desire (within driving distance); we opted for a nice quiet park down the road. It wasn't anything lavish, just a few friends hanging out with some music and card games. There's a surprising amount of space left over (~100 ft<sup>2</sup>), especially after the bit of rearranging I did beforehand (I'll outline my most recent changes in another post), so it wasn't too cramped. Leaving the back gate open to let the fresh air in made the whole event feel more like a BBQ or camping than anything else. Overall, it was a great time, and I'm grateful to have a group of friends who accept me despite the fact that I'm completely deranged.</p>

<p>I was talking to someone, who we'll call Michael (because that's his name), about the truck life and this blog, and he said, "You know, it'd be cool if you had a place on the site where you could see how much money you've saved." Well Michael, I agree with you wholeheartedly, so starting today, there'll be a live-updating clock on the <del>right</del> left side (or bottom on mobile) of the page that shows the amount of money I've saved by living in a truck. I've mentioned on numerous occasions that it's not entirely about the money, but regardless, it's an interesting metric to have. However, without an explanation as to how I arrived at that value, this whole thing would be pretty pointless. So here is my magic money formula.</p>
<h2>The Recipe</h2>
<p>The formula itself is pretty simple. I alluded to it <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5113880120393728">in this post</a>, but stated more explicitly, the formula is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Savings = Time In Truck*(Cost of Rent - Truck Insurance) - Cost of Truck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I'm glossing over the units here, but "Time in Truck", "Cost of Rent", and "Truck Insurance" are all measured by the month, and the cost of the truck was the initial investment. Now let's plug some numbers in.</p>
<h3>Time In Truck</h3>
<p>The "Time in Truck" is the total amount of time I've been living in a truck instead of paying rent somewhere. My first night in the truck was my first day of work, and would have been roughly when I moved into an apartment if that's the route I had gone. So "Time in Truck" is the number of months (as a decimal value) since May 26<sup>th</sup>, 2015. As of this writing, it's about 1.863 months, assuming 30-day months for simplicity.*<p>
<h3>Cost of Rent</h3>
<p>Since I didn't end up getting an actual apartment, it's impossible to know the actual amount I'd have paid in rent per month. However, I do know that I was looking for a studio apartment in the Mountain View area, and luckily there are more than enough services that can tell me, on average, how much that would cost me. <a href="http://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> is the premier service for buying, selling, and renting online. They have a pretty extensive database of housing prices, especially with respect to time. <a href="http://www.zillow.com/mountain-view-ca/home-values/">According to their site</a>, as of May 2015, a studio apartment in Mountain View averages $2,180 a month. So that's what we'll use for our "Cost of Rent" value.</p>
<h3>Truck Insurance</h3>
<p>It turns out I'm not entirely off the hook for all monthly expenses. My sole monthly, truck-related expense is insurance, which costs me about $121 a month. In all likelihood, I'd still get a car and pay for insurance if I wasn't living in the truck, but to make my estimates conservative, we're not going to consider that.</p>
<h3>Cost of Truck</h3>
<p>I've mentioned before, but after haggling, fees, repairs, and taxes, the truck cost me almost exactly $10,000.<p>
<h3>The Final Formula</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Savings = Time*(2180 - 121) - Cost of Truck = Time*2,059 - 10,000</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>But wait, why is it negative?</h2>
<p>At the time of this writing, my net "savings" are a little over &#8722;$6,100. It's negative right now because I spent more money buying the truck than I've saved on rent. But if you've been paying attention, you may have noticed that we can calculate the "break-even point", where Savings = $0. Using a tiny bit of math and a tiny bit of Wolfram Alpha, we can see that my break-even point will occur on <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10000%2F%282180-121%29+months+from+May+26th%2C+2015+12%3A00am">Wednesday, October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2015 at 4:50 PM</a>. I'll have to throw a party or something. I'll certainly make a post noting the clock is <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?q=in+the+black+meaning">in the black</a>.</p>
<sub><em>*Yes, I'm well-aware that assuming a 30-day month will cause the calculated savings to drift further away from the actual savings as time goes on. I don't particularly care right now, maybe I'll use a more accurate measure in the future.</em></sub>

<p>I'm not talking about securing in the sense of safety and making something inaccessible, but rather in making sure something stays static relative to its container.</p>
<p>When you're setting up your room or a new piece of furniture, generally the last thing on your mind is making sure it stays in place. It's basically just a given that your various belongings aren't going to wander around when you aren't in the room. I knew from the start that I'd have to be careful about driving with everything in the back, and one of the first things I did was <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5685265389584384">secure the bed</a> with some rope. Even with proper securement at the forefront of my mind , estimating the stability and safety of various restraints is apparently not my strong suit, and I'd still occasionally find things fallen over after a trip to the post office. So without further ado, here are some things to remember when securing your very own truck-house.</p>
<h2>The Little Things</h2>
<p>When you're building furniture for the truck, you've probably already thought of what it's going to be screwed into, and so it generally isn't the big stuff that gets you, it's the little things that you leave around. An e-book reader, a battery-powered light, the broom, it's usually the most mundane things you'll forget to secure or put away. And nothing is worse than taking that first turn and hearing all your various belongings crash to the floor, and then proceed to roll around for the remainder of your trip. Not pleasant, and easily avoidable.</p>
<h2>Check it or Wreck it</h2>
<p>Sometimes I won't have driven the truck for 3 or 4 days, and I'll forget that I've left a bunch of things sitting on top of my dresser. Oops. Luckily, this is a super easily-remedied problem: Even if you're very on top of putting the little things away, take a quick look in the back before you leave. If there's anything loose back there, put it in a drawer, hang it up, or put it under the covers.</p>
<h2>Velcro is not your friend</h2>
<p>I <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5676830073815040">built a dresser</a> for my clothes and tools early on, and <em>very</em> quickly found out that low-friction rollers do not stay put on their own in the back of a moving truck. I've since developed an acute fear of left turns, which caused all the drawers to fly out and careen across the truck, uniformly showering the ground in my belongings. My brilliant solution to the problem was to secure the drawers with <a href="http://www.velcro.com/">Velcro</a>, which as it turns out doesn't have nearly the holding strength necessary for my purposes. The takeaway here is that you should be using rope or screws to hold everything in place, don't trust Velcro or most adhesives, which weaken with time and temperature.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>In <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5689792285114368">Charting the Waters</a>, I mentioned two books that I picked up to get myself in the travel mindset. Last week, I set aside an hour and read through the lighter of the two: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IPPIWK2">How to Drop Everything And Travel Around The World</a>.</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, I thought the book was a worthwhile read. As far as actual, concrete information about travel and destinations, it was pretty light (the whole thing is only 56 pages), but it was certainly helpful in orienting my mind with respect to my future world tour.</p>
<h3>Getting Excited</h3>
<p>The book did quite a nice job of selling the concept of travel. Not that I needed any convincing whatsoever, but I was definitely getting excited just reading through the first few chapters, thinking about the planning process and choosing my destinations. In particular, the book included a quote from travel writer Pico Iyer, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are differently dispersed. And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again- to slow time down and get taken in, and fall in love once more.
</p>
<p><em>-Pico Iyer</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beginning of this quote is a little too <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucian</a> for my tastes, but nonetheless I agree with its sentiments. There are plenty of things that can only be properly experienced in-person; a newspaper or computer screen simply won't do it justice. It goes almost without saying that travel falls into this category. And while I'm not quite done being a "young fool" in the first place (I do live in a truck, after all), travel will likely kindle a child-like awe contrary to what I've experienced in my (short) adult life.</p>
<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
<p>While the book didn't have much concrete information on travel destinations, it certainly provided me with new, useful travel information.</p>
<h4>Traveling Light</h4>
<p>I've managed to pack my life into a 2' by 2' area in the back of a truck, and thus like to consider myself well-versed in living minimally and "packing light". That said, the book had valuable advice on what kinds of clothes to bring with you to maximize utility and minimize the raw weight and volume of your baggage. I wouldn't have even thought of bringing quick-drying shirts with me on my voyage, so that was a good tidbit to discover.</p>
<h4>Regional Snapshots</h4>
<p>One of the useful things the book provided was single-paragraph snapshots of different areas of the world, broken down into 8 regions (South/Southeast Asia, South/Central America, East Asia, Europe, Africa, North America/New Zealand/Australia, Central Asia, and the Middle East). What was particularly nice is that it took the perspective of an English-speaking American, and outlined how cultures in each region are going to vary and what sort of differences Americans can expect.</p>
<h4>Random Tidbits</h4>
<p>Did you know that just the act of planning a trip makes people happier? Me neither, but it's apparently a studied phenomenon. This, along with tips for spotting a good food cart, where to find not-sketchy housing, how to do travel research effectively, and how to travel alone versus with a partner, are all useful pieces of information provided by the book in various forms.</p>
<p>All in all, the book helped me get my head in the travel game and get excited for planning my future trips. For $3, totally a sound investment.</p>

<p>Back again with another riveting installment of Questions and Answers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mountain View has a car show during its Thursday Night Live series of events. Are you in that?</strong></em></p>
<p>Erm, no. Though if I ever go fully insane and paint the outside of the box with flames and other crazy shenanigans, I'll definitely start attending some car shows. I could go the full nine yards, get an amp and put a sound system in the back, maybe a disco ball or two. Open up the back gate and have a good old-fashioned truck <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Rager&amp;defid=878983">rager</a>. I could even make a business out of it, call it "Block Party in a Box". Or I could not do any of those things, that's also an option.</p>
<p><em><strong>Can people be in the back of the truck while you drive it? If no, could you attach seatbelts to your bed or something to make it kosher?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm not going to look up the driving laws surrounding this, because common sense dictates that it's illegal, much in the same way that riding in the back of a pickup truck is illegal, at least outside of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South">Deep South</a>. <em>Theoretically</em> though, since I've secured everything down in the back, someone would be totally fine laying in the bed with someone driving, as long as they weren't going full-NASCAR. It'd actually probably be pretty cool, like a discount, white trash version of <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/space-mountain/">Space Mountain</a>. Continuing the trend of monetizing my housing, I could just paint a huge "White Trash Space Mountain" sign on the side (next to the flames), and charge $5 for a ride up and down the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_101">101</a>. Again, I could also just not do that instead.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have an emergency plan for when your truck gets stolen/explodes? Because then you will be extra homeless</strong></em></p>
<p>For all the planning I did to get where I am, I've never really thought of any particularly good contingency plans. I've always known that if things don't work out, I can just fall back to an overpriced apartment for normal people, but I've never concerned myself with worrying about various truck-related disasters. Regarding the "stolen" scenario: Virtually no carjackings occur on the company campus, and it's surrounded by video cameras. If anyone was dumb/crazy enough to steal my gross, dumpy vehicle while it's surrounded by Teslas and Porches, they're going to get caught fairly quickly. The whole explosion scenario is far more likely, because it has about 160,000 miles on it, and while there's no outright mechanical issues with it, I wouldn't want to be my car insurance company. If it were to die on me (preferably not in a blaze of glory), I'd pack my gym bag with a few outfits, have it towed to a repair shop, and stay at an <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnB</a> or a hotel for a few nights. Hardly the worst thing that's ever happened to someone.</p>
<p>A few of the questions were comments on site features, and I've implemented a few of them, and some more are on the way. The Question/Comment box and the About/Search box should show up on more pages now, and I'll be adding in "Previous/Next" buttons from individual posts soon, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Okay, that's definitely a bit of a dramatic title, but I am definitely not happy with this turn of events. This actually happened two weeks ago, but I've been busy vacationing in LA (staying in a hotel, with a real room!) and haven't been posting.</p>
<p>Anyway, as you can see, someone has hit and damaged my front-left blinker, dislodging it from its socket and ruining a perfectly pleasant afternoon. They didn't leave a note, not that I should be expecting decency from a reckless stranger anyway. After a (very little) bit of sleuthing, I think I understand what happened though.</p>

<p>Looking at the damage, it's immediately clear that a taller, larger vehicle is the source of my woes. The scratches are higher up than a car or truck's front bumper would be. Additionally, the area I'm parked in is near where the corporate buses queue up before going about their routes. In all likelihood, a bus took the turn too tight, and the tail swung out into my poor house-truck. The driver may not have even noticed.</p>
<h2>The Lesson</h2>
<p>Like I've said before, I'm constantly learning new things and encountering situations that nothing in my past could have prepared me for. I can say with a fair bit of confidence that if I lived in an apartment, I'd be significantly less likely to experience someone busting their car through my wall like a <a href="http://www.koolaid.com/">Kool-Aid Man</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers">Transformer</a>-hybrid. But I live in a parking lot, and I guess car/house-accidents just come with the territory. The upshot is that since my house is mobile, I can move it to a spot out of the path of bus-destruction, which is exactly what I did. The damage isn't bad enough that I need to get it fixed immediately, and I'll try my hand at fixing it up before I bother a mechanic about it, especially since if the bodywork took them a few days, I'd have to relocate temporarily. Stay tuned for a future home improvement post.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>It appears I have a few prolific inquirers, so here goes Q &amp; A round two.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is what you're doing illegal?</strong></em></p>
<p>There's two underlying questions here. First, is being homeless illegal, and second, are you homeless if you live in a car. To briefly answer the second one: living in a car is <em>definitely</em> considered being homeless, but I'll address that in one of the later questions. As for the legality of being homeless, I had trouble finding relevant city ordinances for where I frequently park, but nearby cities like <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/08/06/2423041/palo-alto-homeless/">Palo Alto</a> and <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/11/10/3590672/manteca-homeless/">Manteca</a> have cracked down in recent years. Additionally, there's <a href="http://ssrn.stanford.edu/delivery.php?ID=951089070074087024003118099027089002060050030038051052104082030101115065073121083077023022018005104099039122076119065083118112013032027064082016003006092109114097066059040089118011111087095096020120092127127025029088120119106100079028076010113126&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;TYPE=2">an excellent paper</a> that details all of the laws that California cities have regarding homelessness, in addition to providing a bunch of other useful information. Nearby places like San Francisco, Oakland, Sunnyvale, and San Jose all have anti-homeless laws, but there is no statewide ban on homelessness. I might just be missing the ordinances in my specific city, but from what I've read, it might not actually be illegal. Naturally, these laws only apply to public property. Since I'm in a parking lot owned by my company, it's well within their power to "evict" me, if they so chose.</p>
<p><em><strong>Can you please figure out a way to lock yourself in at night? This doesn't seem safe.</strong></em></p>
<p>I've mentioned my door situation before, it's one of the few things I haven't found a good solution for yet. I have some ideas, and they'll get their own posts when I get around to trying them. It's certainly not the safest situation, but it's no less safe than people who leave their front door unlocked at night. Except my door is giant, metal, and super loud, so any attempted intrusions would immediately yank me from my slumber.</p>
<p><em><strong>You should get a pet!</strong></em></p>
<p>Absolutely not. Not that I don't love animals, I really do, but I think it's frankly unfair to the animal to be subjected to my lifestyle. I <em>chose</em> to live in a box, an animal would not be doing so of their own volition. Even if I brought them to work every day (which is actually encouraged where I work), there'd undoubtedly be times where they'd have to stay in the car, and I'm not a fan of putting an animal in a dark, confined space. So, for the sake of any hypothetical future pets, I'm definitively not getting an animal while I live in a truck.</p>
<p><em><strong>Have you made friends?</strong></em></p>
<p>I have! I lived in the area last year and made some friends then, and they weren't <em>entirely</em> shocked with my housing choices this year. Since I started work, I've also met a bunch of great people who enjoy the novelty of my situation. If whoever asked this question was worried that it's hard to make friends when you're insane and living out of a car: people can be pretty flexible and compassionate. Naturally, not everyone is going to agree with your decisions, but people who can understand someone else's perspectives and choices make infinitely better friends, as a general rule.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you consider yourself homeless?</strong></em></p>
<p>I alluded to this earlier, but there's really two perspectives that you can employ here. In the eyes of the law, I'm definitively homeless. All the cities with anti-homeless laws listed above included a snippet similar to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[They] have daytime laws that criminalize the four basic kinds of activities that can be applied to the homeless: &#8220;(1) standing, sitting, and resting in public places; (2) sleeping, camping, and lodging in public places, including in vehicles; (3) begging and panhandling; and (4) food sharing.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>-Fisher, Marina and Miller, Nathaniel and Walter, Lindsay and Selbin, Jeffrey, California's New Vagrancy Laws: The Growing Enactment and Enforcement of Anti-Homeless Laws in the Golden State</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I said before, it's not quite a "public place", but I am certainly "sleeping, camping, and lodging [...] in vehicles". I guess I'm guilty of "sitting in public places" too though, that's a pretty wide net they're casting with that one. The other perspective, and more to your question, is how <em>I</em> feel about my situation. And I don't feel homeless at all. I have a place I call home, it's distinctly mine, and I feel comfortable being there. Like my tagline says, "Home is where you park it."</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>A few days ago, I opened up a question form where people can ask whatever they want about the truck-life. I've gotten a few questions (potentially all from one person), and I'm going to copy them in all of their unedited, verbatim glory here, and answer them to the best of my ability.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will you be throwing a truck-warming party?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes actually! I don't know specifically when it'll be, or where it'll be (besides in the truck, obviously), but plans are in the works. Moving into a new place can be stressful, as I've undoubtedly alluded to in previous posts. House-warming parties help to take the edge off and ease the transition. I think that the truck-warming party is just as important, if not more of a necessity, than a standard house-warming party would be.</p>
<p><em><strong>Since you have fewer expenses, you should probably just take the extra dolla dolla bills and fill your truck so you can swim in it Scrooge McDuck style.</strong></em></p>
<p>The main reason behind minimizing my expenses, aside from wanting to live simply, is to save up for my eventual travels. While it would be a total <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballers">baller</a> move to fill my truck with freshly minted dollar bills and swim around in them, I just don't see it happening. Also, I just <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%2815+foot+7+inch+*+7+foot+5+inch+*+6+foot+5+inch%29%2F%280.0043+inches+*+6+inches+*+2.5+inches%29%29+dollars">did the math</a>, and using stacks of one dollar bills, I'd still need $19.9 million dollars to fill up the entire box. That means filling it halfway would still be nearly $10 million, and even if I crumpled them up (to increase their volume), it'd still be a pretty pricey ordeal. Turns out living in a truck doesn't make you Scrooge McDuck-status wealthy.</p>
<p><em><strong>I noticed there are no sources for your images. ARE A THIEF? Gosh.</strong></em></p>
<p>I try to take pictures and use those whenever possible, but I do frequently resort to <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl">Google Image Search</a>. And despite the caps lock and sassy attitude, you have a pretty good point, I should give credit where credit is due. I'll add in that feature very soon, and I'll update all of the old images.</p>
<p><em><strong>How fast can your truck go?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, I've never quite taken it drag racing, but I do like to keep up with highway speeds so I don't get run down by a stressed-out techie with road rage. The truck will go about 75 miles an hour if you ask it nicely, though it's definitely much more comfortable not moving at all.</p>
<p><em><strong>When you go traveling, are you planning on doing it all in the truck? Or will you (temporarily?) abandon your truck?</strong></em></p>
<p>I haven't written a post about this yet, but the first part of my trip will be a road trip back to Boston, where I'll hit all the major landmarks and attractions on the way back. I'll drive/live in the truck for this part, and then I'll store it in Boston while I do my traveling. At no point will I actually abandon the truck, just store it away for safe-keeping.</p>
<p><em><strong>You should probably just get a nestcam and live stream the inside of the box all the time.</strong></em></p>
<p>So this isn't actually a question, but neither was the Scrooge McDuck one. Anyway, even if I did do this (incredibly creepy) thing, it would be super boring to watch for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm never there.</li>
<li>When I am there, I'm getting ready for bed.</li>
<li>If I'm not doing that, I'm cleaning or folding laundry.</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn't buy a truck to spend all my time in it or host lavish dinner parties, I bought it for almost expressly the purpose of sleeping. I've mentioned it before, but if you're living a large portion of your waking hours inside a small box, you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Those were all the <em>generally reasonable/answerable</em> questions/comments I've received so far. As always, I'm more than happy to answer any questions, so the box is on the side if you're feeling particularly curious.</p>

<p><em>Tips from the Truck is a new series I'm starting now, where I talk about the various little things you can do to make truck life easier.</em></p>
<p>I briefly mentioned in <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5738600293466112">this</a> post that eating out all the time can quickly cut into your truck savings. Why would you be eating out all the time, you ask? Because <strong>you can never, under any circumstances, keep food in your truck.</strong> Even non-perishables, you don't want to keep any vaguely organic, edible substances within like a 100-foot radius of your abode. You might be saying to yourself, "Brandon, doesn't that seem a little excessive? What if I get hungry at night and want a <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/">Clif Bar</a> or something?" To which I say, Too Bad<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned before, my place of work extends many benefits to me, one of them being free meals. While certainly helpful, free meals are not a requirement for living in a truck. Aside from the <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=56681">benefits of being physically removed from the possibility of late-night eating</a>, there's a much more practical reason I don't keep food in the truck: lions, tigers, and bears.<sup><sup>oh my!</sup></sup> Okay, maybe not actually those three animals in particular, but the literal last thing you want to deal with is an infestation/intrusion of any kind. I keep nothing even remotely edible in the truck, aside from maybe a small, tightly-sealed bag of <a href="http://www.gnc.com/GNC-Pro-Performance-AMP-Amplified-Wheybolic-Extreme-60-Original-Chocolate/product.jsp?productId=3509954">protein powder</a>. The remainder of truck-residing items include a bed and a Velcroed-shut dresser full of clothes and various cleaning products.</p>
<p>And you know what? Despite not having anything for bugs or animals to eat, I <em>still</em> occasionally have to deal with bugs. I reluctantly disposed of two HUGE* spiders yesterday, and became acquainted with more than a few moths while washing my sheets. I'm sure it's mainly due to my door setup, which I'll without a doubt discuss in a future "Home Improvement" post, but basically I keep my door slightly open at night for fresh air and so that nobody can lock me in here and subject me to a pretty embarrassing death. Back on topic, I can only imagine what critters I'd find myself face-to-face with if I actually had something enticing for them. I saw a stray cat walk by a few nights ago, who's to say it wouldn't have decided to move in if I had some sweet treats just laying around? And it's hard enough to clean things in here, with limited access to waste disposal, you want to generate as little trash as possible, the absolute last thing you want is a raccoon rummaging through your things because  you threw a candy bar wrapper away three weeks ago. The main, and really only, takeaway from this is that if your setup is even remotely like mine, or you plan on having a setup even remotely like mine, don't bring food in it, the results may take away your appetite.</p>
<p><sub><em>*They weren't actually huge, in fact, they were tiny. But they looked super menacing in the sub-standard truck-lighting.</em></sub></p>
<p><em>Final Note: I added a Question box to the site, so if you have any burning questions, you can anonymously submit them, and I'll do my best to answer them in future posts.</em></p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I'm a very judgmental person, I have been for as long as I can remember. It's certainly not a trait that I'm proud of, it's just always been easier for me to dismiss people based on superficial observations than to actually try to understand anything about them. If neither software engineering nor driving buses work out for me, I can readily imagine myself becoming a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dunk-David-Lubar/dp/0618439099">dunk tank clown</a>, because I'm quick to recognize "flaws" with a cursory glance.* I'm sure a proper psychiatric evaluation would conclude that it stems from some deep-seated insecurity that I've yet to acknowledge, but that's entirely beside the point.</p>
<p>So anyway, a couple weeks ago, I'm sitting in my <a href="http://cafeolympus.com/">favorite cafe</a>, as I often do, and I see an older gentleman playing some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">Anime</a>-styled video game. My first few thoughts upon seeing this went something like, <em>What a weirdo. Jesus buddy, get a room. Seriously, does he even realize how ridiculous he looks right now?</em>, and so on and so forth. And normally at this point, I'd gently scold myself and make no actual effort to reform this nasty, completely unconstructive habit of mine. But on this day, I happened to be feeling a little more self-aware, and as a result, had a much more constructive response to myself, which went something like the following:</p>
<p><em>Brandon, you are straight up <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A%20homelessness">homeless</a>. On a daily basis, you climb into and out of the back of a large, decrepit moving truck. You have met human beings that know this about you, and are still willing to associate with you. If everyone was as dismissive and judgmental as you are being right now, the world would be a cold, sad, awful place. Don't be such a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=douchebag">douchebag</a>, your insolence is toxic and is a great way to alienate yourself from all of the really interesting people in the world. More often than not, people have valid and compelling reasons for doing the things they do, and there could be an innate beauty in their hobbies and habits that you simply can't see from your admittedly limited perspective. Don't shut people out and dismiss them so blithely, at the very least, their presence will show you new ways of seeing the world.</em></p>
<p>That's that. Having a close-minded attitude towards perspectives other than my own doesn't suit me well now, and certainly won't be any more beneficial in my future travels. Applying my own <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5700735861784576">Litmus Test</a> to my actions makes it clear that I'm not doing a service to anyone with my attitude. So that changes now.</p>
<p><sub>*<em>I put "flaws" in quotes because of the idea of perfection that I discussed at the end of <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5657382461898752">this</a> post, mainly that to be flawed is to be human and to expect or want anything else is naive.<sup>in my opinion</sup></em></sub></p>

<p>So I've been at work almost a month now, and living in the truck for just as long. I've definitely established a comfortable routine, and I'm a lean, mean, code-producing machine on my team, so everything is going good. This means I can focus my non-work hours to the real goal: the big trip.</p>
<h2>The Trip</h2>
<p>When I interned in Silicon Valley last summer, I realized a few very important and related things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm horrifically uncultured/culturally-unaware.</li>
<li>I'd like to change that.</li>
<li>The world is full of beautiful and amazing places.</li>
<li>Of all these beautiful and amazing places, I've only ever seen a small handful of them.</li>
<li>I'd like to change that too.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've mentioned this here and there, but as a reminder, the end-goal of this whole situation, the culminating experience of 4+ years of van-life, is a world-encompassing expedition. Realizing how little I've done, seen, and know helps me put into perspective just how important this goal is for me. I want to experience as much of the world as possible, and over the course of the next few years, as I save money and my stocks vest and my investments grow, I'm going to plot out the journey in excruciating detail, making sure that I don't miss anything. I'm only going to be young and able for so long, now is the time to do this.</p>
<h2>Plotting the Course</h2>
<p>Right now, I have a very broad idea of what I want to do, and a very limited idea of what is <em>actually</em> out there in the world for me to experience. I know I want to spend at least six months traveling. I know I want to visit all the (inhabited) continents. I know I want to learn the basics of a few languages. But beyond these few basic desires, I don't have much concrete knowledge as to what I should even be looking for. Luckily, I'm not the only human being on the planet, and I can draw on the near infinite wisdom of the rest of the world's past and present human beings through the endlessly useful invention of  The Book<sup>TM</sup>. To get warmed up, I've purchased two whole books.</p>
<h3>Book #1: How to Drop Everything And Travel Around The World</h3>
<p>A vaguely gimmicky title yes, and not a super thick book, but it has exactly what I need: firsthand travel experience from someone way more knowledgeable about the topic than me. The text certainly isn't exhaustive, but at the very least, it'll point me in the right direction regarding things like: learning languages, adapting to new cultures, understanding the philosophy of travel, and tons of other useful skills. It's basically a Sparknotes-edition of what I want my life to look like a few years down the road.</p>
<h3>Book #2: 1,000 Places to See Before You Die</h3>
<p>This book is some serious business. In it's physical form, it's 1200 pages of tiny text, a nearly comprehensive guide of places to travel to, and what to do when you get to them. And while it's naive of me to make any estimates without having read any actual content yet, I'd like to reach at least 250 of them in this trip. That may be a feasible goal, it may not be, I have absolutely no idea at this point. But reading this book, in it's entirety, will help me understand more about the cultures of the world and how to adequately approach them, as well as less abstract, more practical things like where to stay, what events to go to, and what to eat.</p>
<p>Like I said, this is just the start, and I'm sure I'll have a better idea of what to read/do/learn next once I start reading these books. I have years to go, and all the time I need. The sky is the limit and the world is my oyster: you bet I plan on being the most high-flying fisherman I can be.</p>

<p><em>Unfortunately, I'm not talking about some more RV/Hippie Van/Truck neighbors.</em></p>
<p>No matter how well you plan out things, life always has a way of throwing little things at you to make sure you're still paying attention. For the past week, life has been throwing the sound of jackhammers in my direction. It makes perfect sense that construction crews would work at night, when normal human beings aren't at work and getting in their way, but I certainly was not expecting the parking lot I call home to be subjected to such perils. Like, they're actually tearing up 10' by 10' sections at a time, something to do with pipes or electricity or whatnot. I'm a computer systems engineer, not a mechanical engineer, I have no idea how any of this stuff works. It makes me think back to when I was considering getting soundproofing installed by that <a href="http://www.happyvans.com/">Happy Vans</a> company in San Jose. It's still not really an issue, the truck actually does a surprisingly good job of blocking it out, and I haven't had any trouble falling asleep. Still, just goes to show you that there will always be something, whether it's crows, radioactive waste, or jackhammers.</p>
<p>In any case, I enjoy the variety and dynamic unpredictability of the whole situation.</p>

<p>Something I noticed when I first bought this truck was that it had a special permit in it. A special permit issued by the "Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration", authorizing it to carry&#8230;something? I'm not actually sure what this truck was used for prior to my purchase, some sort of commercial activity, and I know for a fact that it started it's life as a simple <a href="https://www.budget.com">Budget</a> truck. Call it stubbornness or naivety, but I'm not particularly interested in finding out what it actually was carrying. I've lived here a month with no adverse effects, and I've even noted my <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com/view?key=5733935958982656">improved sleeping abilities</a>. Who knows, maybe my ability to sleep is from toxic fumes knocking me out every night, or maybe one morning I'll wake up and all my hair has fallen out and I'll have developed some new, baffling form of respiratory cancer. That would be an interesting one to explain to a doctor. Best case scenario, the truck was carrying radioactive waste and my exposure is slowly giving me super powers. Worst case scenario, the truck was carrying radioactive waste and my exposure is slowly turning me into a character from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454841/">The Hills Have Eyes</a>.</p>
<p>All I know for sure is that I'm living in a truck that has "special permit authorization" to carry hazardous wastes. Given that the only things that this truck carries are me and my livelihood, that permit is effectively calling me hazardous waste. In any case, I'm authorized to carry hazardous wastes well into the year 2017, which I'm <em>sure</em> will <em>totally</em> come in handy at some point.</p>
<sub><em>Side note: I totally passed all three CDL knowledge tests (general, air brake, and passenger) on my second try! Just goes to show you that actually practicing and preparing for something can go along way, which I like to think is analogous to how the next four years of planning my travels will turn out.</em></sub>

<p>I occasionally mention how glad I am that I'm able to live the way I do, but it's definitely not for everyone. In fact, the reason I'm able to do this is mainly because of the benefits afforded to me by the company I work at. Not that I expect many people are envious of my lifestyle, but for all those aspiring to live out of some type of vehicle, here is a list of hard requirements, collected through experience and in no particular order, that your life should possess before you consider trying to live in a box truck.</p>
<h2>Hard Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good weather.</strong> You need to live in a place where the outside conditions are bearable year round. And when I say bearable, I mean you need to be comfortable sleeping in them. Unless you get extremely fancy (at which point, why bother?), you aren't going to have heating or cooling in your truck, so if you aren't in a temperate area, your life is going to be unpleasant for at least part of the year. I live in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area">Bay Area</a>, which is about the most temperate, tolerable place on the planet, and even <em>I'm</em> mildly uncomfortable on particularly cold or hot nights. Make sure you're comfortable with mild discomfort.</li>
<li><strong>Access to facilities.</strong> You need to have a place to shower and go to the bathroom. Period. Living in a truck doesn't mean you get to abandon personal hygiene, in fact it means you have to step it up a notch so people don't think you're insane <em>and</em> gross. This means that regardless of where you're showering, whether it's the office, a local gym, or a bathhouse, you <strong>do</strong> need to be showering. Going to the bathroom in a crate is not sustainable, and also makes me legitimately sick to think about. You're a minimalist, not an animal.</li>
<li><strong>Money upfront.</strong> It isn't cheap to start living in a car. First off, you have to have the damn car, and depending on what you want to live in (make sure to get something with at least a <em>little</em> bit of extra room), that's going to cost you anywhere between $5,000 and $20,000. This is not a cheap or short-term endeavor. Second, you'll have to pay more for insurance, which is higher for larger and commercial vehicles. Expect to pay anywhere from $750 to $2,000 a year. Depending on what your previous housing situation was, you'll also need a few pieces of furniture, namely a bed and some sort of storage unit. Check <a href="https://www.freecycle.org/">Freecycle</a>, <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>, and if those fail, <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/?cid=us|ps|PST_BR_Core|go|IKEA">Ikea</a>. Basically, you've got to spend money to save money, if that's even why you're considering this.</li>
<li><strong>An address.</strong> When you don't live in a building, you don't get the luxury of having mail sent to it. You're going to need either a dependable friend or family member close by who is willing to let you use their address, or you're going to need a <a href="http://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/Pages/index.aspx">Private Mailbox</a>. You need to have a real, deliverable address to put on official documents, apply for things like insurance, and get letters and packages to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so those are all the things that you absolutely need to have before you journey down this road. Here are a few other things that certainly won't hurt.</p>
<h2>Soft Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be comfortable with yourself.</strong> If you're self-conscious or place a lot of value on other peoples' opinions of you, you're going to have a really tough time. You'll eventually have to explain to someone that you live in a car, and not everyone is going to be so receptive of that. If you can't handle people not accepting your lifestyle, definitely don't do this. You need to be able to admit to yourself that you're a little insane, and that this isn't something reasonable human beings do.  I frequently find myself giggling at just how ridiculous it is that I'm driving my house down the highway. Sometimes, people may see you getting in or out of your car and notice that you clearly live in it. If that bothers you, this might not be the lifestyle that you're looking for.</li>
<li><strong>Have (time-consuming) hobbies.</strong> Your car isn't really meant for hanging out in, and even if you try, it's just not a place conducive to being fun. After work and on weekends, if you don't have any itinerary or activities planned for yourself, you're going to get bored very quickly. Personally, I make new websites, work on this blog, exercise, and amble around the Bay Area, exploring what it has to offer. Sleeping and walking in circles in the back of a truck are not valid hobbies.</li>
<li><strong>Be a decent driver.</strong> This is more for people who are going for box trucks, RVs, school buses, and the like. Vans and small trucks don't really have this issue, but as I've mentioned before, maneuvering and parking a large vehicle in an urban area can be exhausting, even when planned out. And if you aren't a careful driver, an accident here costs a lot more than an insurance premium: it effectively makes you homeless. So don't drive your house around if you can avoid it, and when you do have to drive it, be a <em>very</em> careful and alert driver.</li>
<li><strong>Be flexible and adaptable.</strong> If you're high maintenance and accustomed to a certain lifestyle, it really should go without saying that this isn't the best course of action for you. And even if you are flexible, living in such a dynamic environment means that the requirements of your life can be constantly changing. If you aren't self-sufficient and able to react quickly to the various road bumps (quite literally) of life, truck-living will get discouraging very quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things considered, if you're doing this to save money, make sure you actually plan it out first. I'm not talking casually daydreaming about it the day before you do it, I'm talking research and cold, hard numbers. Make a spreadsheet or something. Be very liberal with estimating the cost of various things, you'd rather be surprised by how much money you have than how little. Between eating out all the time, a gym membership, increased insurance, a private mailbox, and other random things that you'll end up paying for, you want to be sure that the lifestyle is indeed more economically feasible than the alternatives, again, if that's your goal. It's certainly less convenient in some ways than having a house or apartment, so if you're paying more in the long run, you're probably doing it wrong.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>As I've mentioned before, I drove buses in a past life (read: two months ago). That meant that in Massachusetts, I had a Commercial Driver's License. The <a href="http://umass.edu/bus">bus company</a> that I had worked for over the course of the past four years graciously trained their drivers and paid them, but in the Real World<sup>TM</sup>, obtaining a CDL  can be super expensive. Most driving school websites don't list their prices, but <a href="http://www.parkercdl.com/pay-as-you-go.php">this one</a> has a quote of $225 for a 2-hour private lesson. Considering you need ~50 hours of instruction and driving experience to take the test (which is another $300 on that site), that puts the cost of a CDL at over $5,000. But why am I talking about the price of a CDL? Well initially, I was worried that I'd need one to drive my box truck legally, then after a bit of research in the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/42c566ef-31ac-4df2-a8ed-480619084886/comlhdbk.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CONVERT_TO=url&amp;CACHEID=42c566ef-31ac-4df2-a8ed-480619084886">California CDL Handbook</a>, I found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may drive a 2-axle vehicle with a GVWR of 26,000 lbs. or less with a basic class C license.</p>
<p><em>-California CDL Handbook, 2014-2015</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not that great at estimation, but I'm willing to bet the box truck weighs less than 13 tons, and I <em>think</em> it's a 2-axle vehicle. And this all makes sense, because it's just a decommissioned <a href="https://www.budgettruck.com">Budget</a> truck (you can still see the faded lettering on the front). But anyway, after I realized that I didn't need to keep my CDL, I found out that the conversion process was as simple as taking a few written knowledge tests about large vehicles, air brakes, and how to drive with tons of passengers. This was pretty cool, because like I said before, CDLs are expensive, and it can't hurt to have one. That way, if software engineering doesn't pan out for me, I can still be a truck/bus driver. How glamorous.</p>
<h2>The Quest</h2>
<p>So I glazed over the CDL Handbook for a few days and went and took the test. It's a bunch of common sense questions, and it can't possibly be that hard. Right? Nah, not right. I hadn't taken the test in nearly four years, and I didn't take the preparation seriously. So in my infinite wisdom, I managed to fail not one, not two, but all three tests. So here I am, sitting in a cafe, reading the CDL Handbook cover to cover. Okay, maybe not cover to cover, but definitely at least all of the relevant chapters.</p>
<h2>But seriously, why even bother?</h2>
<p>Aside from the aforementioned cost, having a CDL also makes owning a huge box truck less suspicious. To people who aren't quite so knowledgeable about what you can and can't drive with a regular license, it doesn't seem so outlandish to say that I do some freelance furniture moving, and I need the Commercial Driver's License to operate my freelance side business legitimately. Because otherwise, why wouldn't I just buy a Prius like a normal Californian (or a <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla</a>, like a normal Californian software engineer).</p>
<p>That's still a pretty poor reason to go through all this trouble. I don't actually have a legitimate reason, I just enjoy reserving the right to drive large, hulking vehicles. And come tomorrow morning at 8:15 AM, we'll find out if that's a right that I deserve to reserve.</p>

<p>Every so often, I like to apply a simple <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/litmus%20test">Litmus test</a> to my life to help me figure out a couple things. The test has a single question, and the way I answer this question tells me a lot about how reasonable of a person I'm being, and if I'm living in a sustainable way. The questions is this:</p>
<p><em>If everyone acted the way I'm acting, would it still work?</em></p>
<p>It's a simple enough question, and easy enough to apply to every day life. Next time you're on the highway, ask: <em>If everyone drove the way I'm driving right now, would that be safe?</em> Or maybe the next time you're in the office, check: <em>If everyone put in the same level of effort I'm putting in right now, would the company be better or worse off?</em> It's a simple enough question to be broadly applicable and easy to fit to any situation. I wanted to apply this question to my situation, and I phrased it as follows:</p>
<p><em>Would it be possible for everyone to live the way that I'm living right now?</em></p>
<p>I don't think this one has an easy answer. Or rather, I think the answer is clear, but it depends on the perspective you're looking at it from. So I'm going to play a bit of Devil's advocate, and answer my question.</p>
<h2>Hell No.</h2>
<p>I can hardly imagine what the parking lots would look like if everyone at my company lived in them. They would be packed, there'd be no room for everyone, and the traffic would be completely unbearable. And forget about using the gyms and showers in the morning or at night, there'd consistently be lines out the doors, and the facilities would quickly become gross and worn. Not to mention that dinner is only open at a few cafes on campus, and the lines are bad enough as it is. If everyone was trying to eat all their meals here, the company would have to shutdown the perks all together. If everyone was doing what I'm doing right now, everything would devolve into chaos, and it would happen pretty quickly.</p>
<h2>Totally!</h2>
<p>In a more general sense, experimentation with "decentralizing" the home is not a new concept. A good example of this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_hotel">Capsule hotel</a>, which is a type of hotel in Japan where you sleep in one of hundreds of small pods, and have access to a communal bathroom. This is basically what I'm doing, except instead of a pod, I have a box truck, and the "communal bathrooms" are at my workplace. If we ditch the European value of loving to have ownership over things, particularly land, this is a pretty efficient way to go about things. If everyone's homes were just glorified sleep pods and small storage areas, we'd save an enormous amount of land, energy, water, and pretty much every other resource that we consume. Something mankind has derived countless times in the course of engineering the world is that it's always more efficient to do something big and in bulk. Freight shipping is more fuel efficient, giant gas-powered turbines run more efficiently than cars, and having large communal facilities is more efficient than every individual having their own. Granted, I'm not addressing issues of food or leisure, but in this weird thought-experiment, those can remain basically the same as they are now. The point is that, if we had always organized our lives around small sleeping quarters and large communal services, we'd be dealing with far fewer sustainability issues than we are today. So in this sense, the answer is yes, it is totally possibly for everyone to live how I'm living right now.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Before you get too worried, the title probably isn't what you think it is.</p>
<p>I've heard some strange sounds at night, things that sound vaguely like dirt bikes, drones, jackhammers, fireworks, people playing Pac-Man, you name it: if it's unidentifiable and doesn't belong in a parking lot, I've probably heard it from the back of this box. But there has been one sound I've heard on several occasions, usually in the morning on weekends, that until recently, has been totally baffling to me.</p>
<h2>The Sound</h2>
<p>I can't remember when I first heard it, but in my groggy, half-awake state, I thought it was someone typing up a citation for me. Now, this doesn't make much sense in retrospect, but it sounded like someone typing loudly on a keyboard. When I say loudly, I mean I legitimately imagined someone outside my truck with an old mechanical typewriter, slamming away at keys and watching the tiny hammers force ink onto paper. And to my hazy, early morning mind, this meant that someone was typing up my license plate, prepared to give me a ticket freshly printed from their antique typewriter. Stranger still, in between these loud keystrokes, I'd hear softer pecks, as if they were more gingerly hitting some keys, though less frequently than others. It wasn't until a Sunday morning, when I woke up and had the chance to listen to it for a while, that I figured out what it was.</p>
<p><em>Birds.</em></p>
<p>More specifically, crows. The sound I was hearing was them hopping along the roof of the box, their claws scraping against the metal roof. They must be pretty large, because they produce some thunderous thuds as they plop their way across. The "softer pecks" that I was hearing were actual pecking sounds, on one specific part of the roof.</p>
<h2>The Hole</h2>
<p>Pictured above, the hole is a home improvement project I'm not quite sure how to tackle yet. It's some old damage, probably from someone bumping the truck into a structure that didn't quite fit the 11' clearance requirement. It's been covered up out the outside with duct tape, and on the inside with what looks like a protective spray coating. In the morning, a single beam of light shines through an exposed hole. Not a big deal in my book because, one, it never rains here, and two, I like to think of it as a tiny skylight. But for some reason, whether it's the tape or the coating, the crows just love to peck at it. Regardless of where they initially land on the roof, they always trot on over to this one corner, which is right above my head, and they peck at it until they're sufficiently satisfied they've banged their faces against it enough times and that they've succeeded in waking me up.</p>
<p>No complaints on my end, I'm more than happy to have Nature's alarm clock at my disposal, and anyone who's ever listened to raindrops rhythmically landing on a car roof knows just how relaxing it can be.</p>

<p>As you may or may not have noticed, I've been slowly rolling out new functionality to the site. What I've added so far:</p>
<h2>Box Badges</h2>
<p>Some posts have a little black box truck icon to the right of the title, which means that I was writing the post from inside the box. Since the blog is called "From Inside the Box", it'd be disingenuous of me not to say whether or not I was actually in there while I was writing. This post, for example, was not written from within the box, but rather a <a href="http://cafeolympus.com/">quaint little cafe</a> in downtown Mountain View.</p>
<h2>Search</h2>
<p>If you're looking for a particular post, there's now a search box below the "About" section. Type in your search term and hit "Enter", and <del>I'll</del> the site will do <del>my</del> its darnedest to find the posts that you're looking for. </p>
<h2>From the Top</h2>
<p>If you're just coming on board with all of this, and you're really into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">Shadenfreude</a>, then clicking the "Beginning" button at the top will list the posts from earliest to latest, so you can read up on the hot mess that constituted my first week or two, and get caught up with how I got here.</p>
<h2>Post List</h2>
<p>Similar to search, if you want to see all of the posts in one place, there's an "Index" button at the top that has a chronological list of all the currently available posts.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about adding comments and a few other features, but if you have any requests in the meantime, feel free to let me know!</p>

<p>My parking situation is very much analogous to my housing situation: I don't quite fit in. One of the most difficult parts of my situation, one that I underestimated during the planning process, is trying to fit the silly thing in parking lots.</p>
<p>Imagine this. It's Saturday morning, and you'd like to run some errands. No big deal right, just hop in the car and go do them. Think again. There are two ways your scenario can play out.</p>
<h2>Scenario #1: You're going to the Mall</h2>
<p>Sweet, we're going to the mall, a huge outdoor complex, parking should be a breeze, right? Still wrong. If it's even mildly busy, you're going to be constantly within inches of a multi-car insurance claim, and don't expect any other car on the road to understand that your vehicle doesn't maneuver as tightly as their Prius does. They'll pull right up to your front bumper as you're in the middle of a <strong>very</strong> tight right turn, and then look mortified as you play a game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_%28game%29">Operation</a>/horizontal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbo_%28dance%29">Limbo</a> that would make your childhood self envious. Not to mention the cases where backing up in the middle of a four way intersection becomes necessary. You've never seen fear until you've looked into a soccer mom's anxious eyes as you back your wrought iron tailgate nanometers away from her prized RAV4.</p>
<h2>Scenario #2: You're not going to the Mall</h2>
<p>So you're going to a small store, like a GNC or an Autozone. How do you know where to park when you get there? You don't fit in any old spot. If you're lucky, the spots might be a little longer than usual and you can back your tail end a few feet over the curb. That is if there aren't any poles, street lamps, or sprinklers, and if the curb is low enough that you don't bounce it off the gas tank. Otherwise, you have to hope that the lot is designed so that it butts two parking spots up against each other without any curbs, medians, or trees between them, because then you can just park and take up the entirety of two spots. Oh, and be on the lookout for low hanging branches while you're doing on this, or one of them might get caught in the sheathing on top of the box and rip the whole thing open. My strategy for not destroying my house has been to look up the area on Google Maps ahead of time, scope out a good location, and then hope nothing goes horribly wrong in the actual execution of the plan.</p>
<p>I did quite a bit of internal debating over whether or not the 16' box would be too cumbersome. In the end, I'm glad I have all of the extra space (compared to, say, a 10' box), but if you're even thinking of doing something similar, make sure you're completely comfortable maneuvering large vehicles. I drove 40' buses in college, and I never thought that knowledge would be so incredibly necessary for my future life as a software engineer. Life's funny that way.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I've mentioned in the past that I believe getting enough sleep is a key component to happiness and success. I also believe that the quality of sleep contributes to these factors. Because of this, I've been using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&amp;hl=en">an application</a> on my  phone that tracks my sleep, for the past year. Basically, you tell the application what time you'd like to wake up, and then tell it how much earlier you're willing to be woken up. Then, you put it next to you on your mattress while you sleep, and based on your movements, it can estimate what stage of sleep you're in and wake you up at the best time.</p>
<p>I've definitely noticed that I wake up less groggy most of the time, but since moving out here, I've also noticed something else. The picture above shows two recorded nights of sleep. One of them is from late April, leading up to finals and end of semester projects. The other one is from two nights ago, near the end of my second week of full-time employment. Even though I went to bed later and woke up earlier in the more recent recording, I spent an hour and a half <strong>more</strong> time in deep sleep, which is where your brain is doing most of its resting.</p>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>It could just be an anomaly, and once I have more data, I'll average it all out and get some more concrete results. But I think this aligns with what I was saying in an earlier post, about how quickly I've become adjusted to my new life. I'm actually sleeping noticeably better, not restless or tossing and turning all the time, and it could very well be because, subconsciously, I'm exactly where I want to be with my life. Or maybe not, maybe this was just one strange reading, or maybe the new bed is just more comfortable, or maybe I'm incorrect in correlating deep sleep with happiness. In any case, time will tell.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>As I've talked with more and more people about my living situation, I've noticed a few questions that come up all the time. I'm going to answer them here in full, gory detail.</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you go to the bathroom at night? Do you just pee in the woods?</strong></em></p>
<p>As cool as it would be, my life is not an episode of <em>Man vs Wild</em>. I do have 24 hour key card access to any building on the campus that I work at, so I could use the facilities in there if I really needed to, but thus far it's just been about planning. I try not to eat or drink anything after about 7:30 PM, and I wash up and go to the bathroom right before I head out to the truck at night. When I wake up in the morning, I ride my bike to the gym and go to the bathroom there.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where do you, like, shower and stuff?</strong></em></p>
<p>I've mentioned this one in an earlier post, but my employer has showers and gyms on campus, mainly because a lot of people bike into work and need to shower off so the office doesn't smell like a frat house. So every morning, I wake up nice and early (around 5:30 AM), ride my bike to the gym, work out, shower, and start my day. While I could skip the gym and go straight for the showers, I feel like that would look strange. Even if I got passed that, keeping that regimen of working out every day is a good habit to be in.</p>
<p><em><strong>Don't you get lonely out there?</strong></em></p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that I'm hardly ever in here, except to sleep. I'm working until 5 or 6 PM, and then hanging out with friends or working on personal projects until 8:30 or 9 PM. When I'm in the box, I'm either writing these posts or getting ready for bed. The whole point of this experience is that a bed was the only part of a house that I needed, so if I was in here all of the time, I'd be doing it wrong.</p>
<p><em><strong>How much money are you saving?</strong></em></p>
<p>A really cheap apartment in the Bay Area (and I'm talking <em>really</em> cheap), would be about $1,000 a month, bare minimum. So over the course of four years, I'd be paying (again, bare minimum here) about $48,000 in rent, and have nothing to show for it. No physical property, no equity, nothing. After taxes, the truck cost me $10,000, plus about $750 a year for insurance. Let's also factor in the cost of gas. Assuming it gets about 10 miles to the gallon, and I drive it about 25 miles a week (I don't really drive it much at all), that's 2.5 gallons a week, and 130 gallons a year. On a pricier week, gas is $4 a gallon, so that's $520 a year. So $10,000 + $750 * 4 + $520 * 4 = $15,080. So for a super conservative estimate, I'm saving about $33,000 over the course of four years. That's just the raw minimum savings, I'll be investing approximately 95% of all of my post-tax, post-401k, post-benefits income. I've mentioned many times that it isn't about the money, but clearly this living situation  makes my future plans much more flexible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Have you ever been caught?/Where do you keep the truck?/What happens when you get caught?</strong></em></p>
<p>In the week and a half that I've been doing this so far, I haven't had anyone approach the truck while I was in it or question me or anything like that. I keep it parked at the edge of an open-air parking lot on my employer's campus. If security were to come by, I doubt it would be a big issue. I've registered the car with the company vehicle database, so they know it belongs to an employee, and I've read stories about people at very similar companies having short conversations with security, and then never being bothered again. I'm not very worried about it right now, but if security does come knocking, I'll let them know that I work there. Worst case scenario, they aren't happy and they ask me to leave, at which point I get a membership at the RV parking lot down the street.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you do for electricity?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't actually own anything that needs to be plugged in. The truck has a few built-in overhead lights, and I have a motion-sensitive, battery-powered lamp I use at night. I have a small (15,000 mAh) battery pack that I charge up at work every few days, and I use that to charge my headphones and cell phone at night. My work laptop will last the night on a charge, and then I charge it at work. As I mentioned in a previous post, I could get a solar panel/power bank for real AC power, but I just don't even know what I would use it for right now.</p>
<p>Those were all the main questions I could think of. If you have any more you'd like me to answer, and you're reading this, you probably know me well enough to just ask me.</p>

<p><strong>This is another post on philosophy, take that as you will.</strong></p>
<p>I went out with a couple of co-workers last Friday, and naturally the conversation eventually ended up on my living situation. I've been continually surprised at how receptive people are to the whole concept of living in a car, normally once I explain all of my motivating factors. Mainly, I get a lot of "<em>That's really great! I personally could never do something like that, but power to you for going through with it!</em>", and that's vaguely encouraging for me. Coupling these conversations with all of the time I have for reflection, I've come to realize a few things about happiness.</p>
<p>But first off, before I get into this, I'm going to paraphrase a quote from the movie <em>Pursuit of Happiness</em>, with Will Smith. The quote goes something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Founding Fathers wrote that we are all entitled to "the pursuit" of happiness as a basic fundamental human right. They specifically didn't say that we're entitled to happiness, because everyone seeks happiness in different ways.</strong></p>
<p><em>-(kinda) Will Smith, Pursuit of Happiness</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Defining Happiness</h2>
<p>What is happiness, and what does it actually mean to be happy? At a rote biological level, it's just a specific concentration of various chemicals in various parts of your brain, an evolutionary construct loosely coupled with the concepts of risk, reward, and feedback systems. But that's a boring way to look at happiness, and it totally misses the point. Happiness is a unit of fulfillment. Being happy means that you've established some metric for how you want to conduct yourself, and you're following that metric pretty well. It's how we let ourselves know we're satisfied with our situations, a bit of feedback saying, "Hey, I'm okay with the way that things are going". Conversely, if you aren't happy, it's generally a sign that something needs to change in your life, or you need to reevaluate your metrics for happiness. And naturally, as the diverse bunch of human beings that we are, we all have slightly different metrics for happiness.<p>
<h2>A Metric for Happiness</h2>
<p>Alluding back to what I said in an earlier post, we are constantly being conditioned to think that happiness correlates with how much <em>stuff</em> you have. We treat consumption as if it's the only way to add value and meaning to your life. Even worse (in my opinion), it's not even just about how much you have, it's about how much you have <em>relative to those around you</em>. Indulging in our primal urges for supremacy, we're conditioned to believe that we should only be truly happy with ourselves when our television is at least 4" larger than our neighbors', or when we're the first ones to get the newest iPhone, or when we have landscapers cutting our yards and our neighbors don't. To put it in frank (and mildly vulgar) terms, we're constantly engaged in a dick measuring contest with those around us, and some more good ol' "natural male enhancement" is only a credit card swipe away. And you know what?<p>
<p><em>There's nothing inherently wrong with that.</em></p>
<p>Now certainly, as you can tell from how I'm writing this, this isn't what brings me happiness. But who am I to say it's wrong? If it legitimately brings someone else joy to own more things, regardless of whether or not they need them, why should I trample all over their happiness? It's not my place, and (aside from all of the child and slave labor camps they're indirectly funding), who are they really hurting? That said, I think if we all took a moment and stepped back from our everyday existences to introspect and figure out what genuinely added meaning to our lives, I don't think "buying stuff" would come out at the top of the list. I really don't.</p>
<h2>My Pursuit</h2>
<p>The way I pursuit, and find happiness, is by going to sleep a better person than I was when I woke up. I want to add value to myself, in the form of knowledge, health, and ability every day. In business-esque terms, I'd like to be an appreciating asset. Without trying to sound too much like Ayn Rand, I firmly believe if you work on bettering yourself, the world around you will thrive as a result. And following in that vein, I try to treat myself properly. You only get one body, you're doing yourself a huge disservice if you aren't actively working to keep it functioning well. Exercise, eating right, sleeping well, and removing stress from your life do absolute wonders for every other aspect of your life.</p>
<p>Now this isn't to say that you shouldn't be happy and content with yourself. On the contrary, I believe it's about realizing that we're all fallible and we're all flawed, and that's perfectly fine. It also means that there are always things we can do to be "better" people, in whatever ways we think make us "better". And that's why I think it's important to reflect on what happiness means to each of us, because if we can actually get down to the root of it, we can throw away all the noise and fluff and clutter, and focus on living our terrifyingly short lives in the way that makes them the most fulfilling, and the best they can be.</p>

</div>
<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Ok, so I have a confession: this is the first post that I'm actually typing up <a href="http://frominsidethebox.com">FromInsideTheBox</a>. By the magic and miracles of modern technology, I'm actually able to access the internet by tethering to my cellphone. I've already talked about how this place is starting to feel like home, but I think calling it a dorm room, as someone said to me today, is much more appropriate. It even looks like one (see the picture above for the current state of affairs). The only differences are that it's larger than any dorm room I've lived in, and I'm not sharing it with anyone, which are both pluses in my book (sorry Zach). And while I don't have any problems with it looking like a dorm room, I do have a few plans to make it a little more "homey" in the future.</p>
<h2>The Box and Beyond</h2>
<p>Most of these future plans revolve around a company I stumbled upon called <a href="http://www.happyvans.com/">Happy Vans</a> in San Jose. They specialize in turning cars, trucks, and RVs into homes, and do all sorts of conversions. How perfect is that? I contacted them about some modifications, and they said they're backlogged by about two months, so it'll be a little while before anything actually happens, but here are some of the ideas I've had.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carpeting.</strong> I've considered doing this one myself actually, and it's probably the simplest job on the list. It would have been smarter to do this before I started bolting things (the bed frame piece and the dresser) to the walls and floor though. Oh well. The main reasons I'd like carpeting is to soften the loud creaking sounds I hear when I walk across the hard wooden floor and to stop things from sliding around while I'm driving, not that it's much of an issue now. I guess it would also look and feel nice too.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight.</strong> Just like I have 128 ft<sup>2</sup> of floor, I have 128 ft<sup>2</sup> of ceiling space, which is more than enough room to put in a sunlight. Also note that I call it a sunlight and not a sunroof, I live in this thing far more than I drive it. Anyway, in addition to looking pleasant and letting in ambient light, a sun<strong>light</strong> would enable the next item on my list.</li>
<li><strong>Solar Panel/Power Bank.</strong> This one may seem a little outlandish, but it's a legitimately feasible modification (and also one that Happy Vans offers). Attaching a small solar panel to a part of the sunlight would handily collect enough energy to fully charge a power bank, like a <a href="http://www.duracellpower.com/backup-power/power-packs/powerpack-600.aspx">Duracell Powerpack 1300</a>, for example. And since it's nearly always sunny here, I'd consistently have AC power (aka wall outlets) that I could use for whatever I needed. In my current situation, I charge up a small battery pack at work during the day, and use it to charge my phone and headphones at night. It works fine, and I don't even have anything in the truck that requires AC power at the moment.</li>
<li><strong>Wall Paneling.</strong> As you can see from the picture above, the walls are lined with wooden railings, which is super convenient for securing things, though not all that aesthetically pleasing. Covering them all in some drywall, hell, maybe even some wallpaper would make the whole place look significantly nicer.</li>
<li><strong>Soundproofing.</strong> Before I could do this one, I should figure out a good way to lock the box from the inside, but in a way that nobody could lock it from the outside, which is tricky. But even without that modification, the benefits of soundproofing would be twofold: decreasing the sounds I hear from outside, and decreasing the sounds people hear from inside. Neither of these things have proved to be an issue yet, in fact, I kind of like falling asleep to the sound of crickets and waking up to the sounds of birds.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remembering My Goals</h2>
<p>I also think it's important to note that I don't actually <em>need</em> any of these things. I did need a bed and a place to store my clothes, and if I'm really trying to live in line with my minimalist and utilitarian ideals, then carpeting, a sunlight, paneling, soundproofing, and power are excessive and a waste of resources. Most of the reasoning behind wanting those things is for aesthetic value, and if I really cared about that, why would I be living in a box truck to begin with? I've already accepted my self-induced (truck-induced?) celibacy, spiffing up the back of a truck doesn't exactly scream "romance". And if that's out the window, and these things don't provide any real, necessary benefit to my life or increase my happiness, why consume unnecessarily, and waste money I can put towards my goals?</p>

<p>Look at that <em>stupid</em> thing. With its silly little drawers and its wooden frame. Pfft.</p>
<p>In reality, it's just a simple four drawer dresser from Ikea, which I definitely needed because I've been living out of a suitcase my mother lent me, and I need to return it eventually. This project was my first two-day project, and in total took me about six hours to complete. Nothing went horribly wrong per se, it's just that Ikea is Satan incarnate, as it turns out. As you can probably tell from my demeanor, I've never assembled anything from Ikea before, but I figured for something as simple as a dresser, it couldn't be that bad.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p>
<h2>The Purchase</h2>
<p>Before I even made it into the store, I had to maneuver my unwieldy box truck through the massive fields of tightly packed parking lots. After two unsuccessful laps around, I opted to park across the street. This would turn out to be a Grave Mistake<sup>TM</sup>. Once I finished my box truck slalom session and parked, I found that "Ikea" is Swedish for "Labyrinth". Okay, so maybe not <em>literally</em>, but it really might as well be. I went in knowing exactly what I wanted, and if I had been more well-versed in the art of Ikea, I might have headed straight to the "Self Serve" section of the store. But alas, I'm new to this whole process, and found myself waist-deep in screaming toddlers and strollers as I waded my way through the "Showroom" section of the store. Despite moving at nearly a jogging pace for the entire time I was in the store, it still took me about 15 minutes to make it through all of the twists and turns of the Showroom. I'm not sure if that is a testament to how slowly I jog, or just how massive Ikea stores are. Once I made it to the Self Serve area, I loaded up my un-assembled dresser onto my cart, checked out, and wheeled it down to the parking lot. This part of the process would have been the smoothest, if I hadn't parked across the street. As soon as I wheeled my cart outside the store, the wheels locked up, and unceremoniously tossed my box to the ground. Tragic. Huffing and puffing, I carried the large, awkward, hundred pound box the quarter mile across multiple major intersections back to where I had parked. Sweating profusely, I unlocked the back and tossed the package in.</p>
<h2>Bringing it to Life</h2>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>As I spend more time with the truck, I realize more and more that people really have better things to do than worry about what the crazy box truck guy is doing. As a result, I had no problem ripping open boxes and hammering things together in the back of the truck, parked in the middle of a Nordstrom's parking lot at 7 PM on a Saturday.</p>
<p>This is the part where I realize that assembling the dresser is literally a 24 step process, with 10 different types of screws, nails, and bolts, and nothing but pictures to serve as instructions. I do my best, and make it as far as getting the frame together before I realize that the height of the dresser doesn't line up with the wooden railings, and I have no way of securing it. Exhausted, and mildly discouraged, I wrap some rope around it to hold it in place, and head home for the night.</p>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>After sleeping on my predicament from the previous day, I came up with a solution. Can you guess where it took me? That's right, right back to Home Depot. I measured out the space between the two wooden railings, the same space that lined up with the dresser's mounting bracket. I went into Home Depot, had some wood cut, and picked up a few brackets. Twenty screws, four brackets, and two planks of wood later, I had jury-rigged my own mount to attach the dresser to. I spent the rest of my time in the Home Depot parking lot assembling the draws, securing everything, and unpacking the suitcase.</p>
<h2>The End Result</h2>
<p>The final product is pictured above, and though I'm happy with the result, I can't help but have a bit of disdain for the thing because of the amount of raw effort that it took to get here. I added one final touch, which was securing the draws closed with adhesive Velcro strips, because I don't want to dump all of my belongings on the ground every time I take a sharp turn.</p>
<p>The place is starting to come together. It's clean, organized, and has everything I need. I'm ready for the long haul.</p>

<p>My first two Home Improvement Projects weren't exactly the highest caliber works of craftsmanship. For example, putting more than two or three articles of clothing on the clothes rack caused it to bend, shake, and warp, and the rope around the bed came undone approximately once a day. So my third Home Improvement Project was setting right what I had previously done so, so wrongly. And it's the weekend, which means that after my workout and shower, the sky was the limit as far as errand-running was concerned. </p>
<h2>Back to Home Depot</h2>
<p>Home Depot is a recurring theme/location of these posts, and I'd be pretty lost without it. I recently found out that Home Depot will cut 2x4s for you to whatever length you want, which I thought was pretty sweet because it means that I don't have to buy a circular saw. So I used my handy dandy tape measure (also previously purchased at Home Depot), and took a few measurements.</p>
<h3>Reinforced Clothes Rack</h3>
<p>I cut some 2x4s to be the length of the gap between the pre-installed wooden railings. Learning from my mistakes, I purchased some wood screws this time around, which made the whole process far less painful. I measured out the distance between the 2x4s, again learning from my previous errors. Then I re-secured the hanger mounts and screwed everything back down. The end result is pictured above, this time with a fully loaded rack of clothes, including my heavy jackets and sweatshirts. I have much more faith in this refined, sturdier clothes rack, and I'm starting to get comfortable with do-it-yourself projects.</p>
<h3>Bed "Frame"</h3>
<p>So I didn't quite build a bed frame per se, but I did cut a 2x4 to the width of the box, and then secure it with some angle brackets. This will keep the box spring in place, and I doubt the mattress would be able to overcome the static friction keeping it on top of the box spring. In other words, I ditched the rope, and I'm pretty confident this will work just as well, without the inconvenience of a having a length of rope running through the middle of the box.</p>
<h3>What Next?</h3>
<p>The box is starting to come together! My next project is going to be some carpeting, a little bit for aesthetics, but mainly for noise reduction and for keeping things from moving around. I also purchased a dresser from Ikea, but I'm only half way through putting that beast together, and it will definitely get its own post when it's done.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>I've survived my first (nearly) whole week of work. Granted, it was mostly filling out forms, hearing about benefits packages and retirement plans, and going to developer workshops to get synced up with various company policies and infrastructure. Not that it wasn't interesting (it was), but I'm not a fan of how little I've gotten to contribute thus far. I understand it'll take time to get caught up to speed, I'm certainly not unfamiliar with the concept, though I'd like to start actively applying myself to it. Aside from actual work, there are a few things I hope to accomplish, once the orientation presentations start to quiet down next week and I start to fall into a consistent schedule.</p>
<h2>The Gym</h2>
<p>While I was in school, especially for the last two semesters, I'd settled into a very structured workout plan (Jim Wendler's 5/3/1) that I'd tailored to my needs. I've started going to the gym again (after a three week hiatus), and I'm definitely feeling that intense, all-over soreness that I missed oh-so much. Starting on Monday, I'll get back to my routine, start the first week of a cycle, and put myself back on the road to physical self-betterment, a part of my personal philosophy that I'll probably detail in a future post. Basically, the carrot I dangle in front of myself for motivation is an improved, future version of me.</p>
<h2>Planning The Future</h2>
<p>Falling into a routine means dedicating time after work each day for planning my future. The goal of this whole intense money/resource saving expedition is to save money so that I can travel the world in 4 to 5 years time. I plan on spending the majority of my time until then charting out my course around the world: picking out which countries I want to visit, which sights I want to see, which languages I want to learn, and what events I want to experience. The adult world quite frankly freaks me out, and having a future goal to work towards (aside from retirement) takes the edge off, and gives me more of a sense of purpose.  Again, I'll probably dedicate multiple future posts to my travel plans, this is just a snippet of what I'm working towards.</p>
<p>Basically, consistency is key. There are all sorts of physical and chemical processes that occur in the body that expect routine and consistency. If I can wake up bright and early <em>every</em> morning (okay, maybe to a lesser extent on weekends), hit the gym, go to work, eat three square meals, and then plan my trip and work on personal projects before heading to bed at a predictable time, I'll be doing a service to my mental and physical state, and it'll make me more productive overall. More important than being productive, it'll also bring me closer to reaching my goals.</p>

<p>Don't worry, I'm not going to post about every single night I spend in the box truck, but this one was markedly different than the first, and deserves to be noted as such. When it was bed time last night, I wasn't feeling the same type of anxiousness that pervaded the previous night. I was much more relaxed and confident. I still did my best to be quiet, but I wasn't stopping every few seconds to make sure that nobody was watching. The overall experience was much more pleasant this time around, and I slept like a small child.</p>
<h2>Theories</h2>
<p>I don't know what made me so much more comfortable with the idea and the whole situation after only a single night, but I have a few theories about what is going on with me.</p>
<h3>Acceptance of the Situation</h3>
<p>Maybe I subconsciously realized that it's not the big of a deal, if I have to talk to security or a co-worker, <em>it doesn't really affect anything about my situation</em>. Absolute worst case scenario: I have to move the truck. That's really the worst thing that could feasibly happen, and that would be far from the worst thing that has ever happened in a human being's life. Realizing how large the world (or even just my workplace) is, and how nobody is particularly out to get me, was a big step in calming my nerves. Having the first night go so smoothly made it clear that this whole scheme is actually viable.</p>
<h3>Insanity</h3>
<p>I've mentioned before how I already have accepted that I'm completely crazy, and that normal human beings don't do these types of things, but I can't help but wonder if some mental safeguard has actually snapped, and I'm actually losing my marbles, starting to become comfortable with the fringe lifestyle I'm in the process of adopting, like an even weirder form of Stockholm Syndrome. Maybe the first night was so traumatizing to me that I've now lost all mental faculties keeping me even remotely reasonable. Who knows?</p>
<p>Regardless of why I settled into the new routine so quickly, it shows me something that I think will be increasingly important for me, especially in my future travelling endeavors. It shows that I can adapt. Adapt to an unconventional situation and adapt to a new life. And like I mentioned in an earlier post, this experience and capability will be crucial as I travel around the world without much more than a backpack.</p>

<p>I did it.</p>
<p>And by <em>it</em> I mean sleeping in the box truck for the first time. I still have a corporate apartment until Sunday, but I wanted to try out living in the box truck, because at least I still have the flexibility of normal human housing, and this way, I could work out any potential kinks.</p>
<h2>A Whole New World</h2>
<p>Okay, maybe that's a little bit dramatic, once I was in there, it really just felt like being home, in my own bed. It was pretty comfortable, especially for a mattress that only cost me $99. The eventual goal is still to get a super comfortable memory-foam, fancy-shmancy bed, mainly because I feel that without a solid sleep foundation, the rest of my day suffers and I end up using caffeine as a crutch. Not ideal.</p>
<p>Being completely new to the whole process of living in a van, I was pretty anxious for most of the night. I set up the environment on my work computers to my liking, played some Dance Dance Revolution at an arcade (in my office!), grabbed a late dinner with a few friends, and then headed over to my super secret hiding spot. Interestingly enough, the place I picked to park the box truck was already inhabited by more than a few equally sketchy looking vehicles: an RV, a few hippy vans, and a large truck or two. I have a hunch that I'm not the only person doing this.</p>
<h2>Heading to Bed</h2>
<p>I felt like a criminal walking across the parking lot. It's 9:30 PM, a dark truck with tinted windows <strong>slowly</strong> drives by just as I'm approaching the box truck. My heart is beating out of my chest, I slow down until it drives past, and then open up the back once I'm convinced they've passed. I re-lock the door behind me, leaving it slightly open for ventilation and so that no one can lock me in. I spend the next ten minutes quietly getting undressed and unpacking the suitcase I threw in early in the morning, completely paranoid that someone is watching/listening and going to bust in at any second. I shut off my lantern, and spend the next half an hour listening intently to the silence of the parking lot, interrupted only by the occasional thuds of doors closing and squeaks of suspensions going over speed bumps. Eventually I fall asleep, waking up intermittently because of strange truck and security-related nightmares. When my alarm goes off at 5:30 AM, I silence it immediately. I grab my already-packed gym bag, and I start my day.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>With the bed out of the way, I was ready to try bigger and better things. The next thing on my list was a place to hang my dress shirts and pants. In a real-world setting, this would be called a "clothes rack". So I took another trip down to <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/">Home Depot</a>, which is quickly becoming the most important place in my life, and I picked up some screws, a screwdriver, some clothes hangers, two mounting brackets, and a 6 foot long wooden rod. If I had done everything correctly, here is how the process should have gone:</p>
<ol>
<li>Screw in mounting brackets, approximately 6 feet apart.</li>
<li>Place wooden rod on brackets, screw into place.</li>
<li>Place hangers on wooden rod.</li>
</ol>
<p>So right off the bat, I realized I bought the wrong screws. How did I realize this, you ask? Well for one, they were clearly marked "Sheet Metal Screws", and I was working with wood. I quickly learned that the difference between the two is the threading, which is far more dense on sheet metal screws and makes it <strong>really</strong> hard to put them in, especially without a drill. So after 15 minutes of painfully torquing one of these screws into the wooden railings of the box truck, I was sufficiently satisfied with how far into the wall it was. I put the mounting bracket on over it, tightened it a few more turns, and moved onto the next one.</p>
<p>That doesn't sound all that bad, right? Well that's because I haven't adequately set the scene for you. It's a beautiful, sunny 75 degree day in Santa Clara, and I'm in the back of a nearly ventilated box truck, trying with all my might to fit square pegs (sheet metal screws) into round holes (wood). So anyway, I exhaustingly put up the second mounting bracket (without measuring because that would be reasonable and take all of the fun out of it), only to find out that I've placed the two mounting brackets 6 feet and 1 inch apart, meaning that the wooden rod for hanging the clothes won't rest on the brackets. Tragic. Repeat the bracket mounting process, but now 6 inches over.</p>
<p>Throw in a couple extra screws, because a little over-engineering can't hurt, and the end result is pictured above. How well will it work? Who knows! Only time will tell, but in the mean time, I'm fairly pleased, and ready to take on some even more ambitious home improvement projects as I refine my newly-pioneered form of crazy.</p>

<p>One important part of this whole process is turning the back of a truck into a livable, comfortable space. I have a number of plans and ideas on how to do that, and I'm going to chronicle my attempts at turning them into realities in this "Home Improvement" series. This one is a super basic one, but hey, baby steps. If I plan on living in this thing, I'll need a place to sleep, naturally. So I wandered over to Craigslist, found the sketchiest <strong>new</strong> mattress and box spring set I could find, and placed an order. Notice the word "new", that's super important, because I'm not in the mood for a case of bed bugs or crabs or whatever else you can catch from a used mattress.</p>
<p>Anyway, all I actually did to make this a reality was the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick up the bed.</li>
<li>Remove the plastic from the bed.</li>
<li>Find desired location for bed.</li>
<li>Place bed in desired location.</li>
<li>Make bed.</li>
<li>Tie it down with the rope that I mentioned in a previous post.</li>
</ol>
<p>Voila! I now have a bed.</p>

<p>So I've already laid out my pros and cons of why I'm actually doing this, but there's another aspect to it that I didn't really explore in that post, and it basically revolves around the idea of minimalism.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>We do things big in America. We love our malls, our big meals, our bigger televisions, and our huge trucks and SUVs. We live in a time of unprecedented opulence and convenience, but that doesn't come without its own issues. The main one is that it is <a href="http://www.resilience.org/stories/2008-08-18/our-american-way-life-unsustainable-evidence">completely and utterly unsustainable</a>. I remember learning in a high school environmental science class that it would take the resources of <strong>four or more</strong> planet Earths if everyone on the planet were to live the way Americans do. We're supremely wasteful and consumptive, and it's a lifestyle our grandchildren will certainly not be able to "enjoy".</p>
<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
<p>I feel that I've always been pretty content with what I have, and I don't generally buy things that I don't need. That said, in high school I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN46H7150-46-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B00IDXIL7K/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432502047&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=samsung+6+series+46%27">46 inch television</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BEDQQM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">1000 Watt</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001202C44/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">sound system</a>, which was completely excessive by any stretch of the imagination. I got great use of them yes, using them right up until my graduation from college, but they weren't necessary for me to live the way I wanted to. I gave them away to my sister and a friend, after all, the only things I brought to California with me were some clothes and a laptop.</p>
<p>And from here on out, I'm going to be perfectly content without unnecessary material. I get the most enjoyment from self-improvement, and for me, that comes from books, exercise, and working on personal projects (like this blog). I wouldn't be any happier with a 50 inch television or a Playstation 4, because those don't align with my goals for life*. Being wealthy isn't a function of material, it's a function of contentedness.</p>
<p>*<em class="small">Disclaimer: I do own a smartphone, nice headphones, and a laptop, and as a result I have undoubtedly contributed to the suffering of many child workers in factories at Foxconn and elsewhere. I view these devices as necessary 21<sup>st</sup> century tools for doing my job effectively, and I strive to take care of them and only replace them when necessary.</em></p>

<p>When you move into a new home, a trip or two to Home Depot isn't just likely, it's inevitable. Turns out that holds true even when your new home is a box truck. Below, I've detailed the unfocused and wide-ranging list of items I found myself purchasing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graffiti Remover.</strong> I didn't quite find the truck in the most perfect condition. One tire was gouged pretty badly and the left side had been tagged up pretty good. The tire is all fixed, and the graffiti remover is surprisingly effective, but I've got a lot of area to clean - by my measure about 37 ft<sup>2</sup>. A couple more trips to an empty parking lot to clean it and I should be all set.</li>
<li><strong>Work Gloves.</strong> To keep my hands from being coated in graffiti remover.</li>
<li><strong>Step Ladder.</strong> To reach the top of the graffiti, though I actually haven't needed it yet.</li>
<li><strong>Rags.</strong> To wipe off and mop up the graffiti.</li>
<li><strong>Hornet Killer.</strong> Another pleasant feature of the truck, small hornet nests in both door crevices. Haven't gotten around to taking care of this yet, mainly because hornets are terrifying. They're like bees, but less fuzzy, more menacing, and can sting you until they're completely sure you're miserable.</li>
<li><strong>Rope.</strong> Until I start building/buying legitimate mounting equipment, I need a way to make sure big things (like the bed) don't move around too much while I'm driving. I don't want a few sharp turns or hard brakes to mean rearranging the furniture. I'll post pictures eventually, but basically I tied sliding knots around the rails on either side of the truck.</li>
<li><strong>Switchblade.</strong> To cut the rope, and just generally handy.</li>
<li><strong>Broom.</strong> To sweep up the dust and trash that was in the back. I like to keep my truck dungeon clean.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Bags.</strong> To dispose of the dungeon dust and trash, though I actually need to find a waste disposal place in the area.</li>
<li><strong>Padlock.</strong> To lock up the back when I'm not "home".</li>
<li><strong>Tape Measure.</strong> Generally useful, mainly for figuring out placement of shelves and furniture in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Battery Lamp.</strong> The truck actually has some built-in lights in the back, but I got an extra one for good measure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only reasonable theme to glean here is that I'm a serial killer. Between the rope, trash bags, switchblade, gloves, and padlock, I'm surprised Home Depot didn't call the FBI as soon as I made it to the checkout area.</p>

<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>So here we are, almost a week into living in California. How have things progressed, you ask? Well allow me to tell you!</p>
<h2>Second Thoughts</h2>
<p>Arriving in California was comforting, but also a little overwhelming, and my roommate's words kept echoing around in my head, haunting me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don't live in a van. Don't do it.</strong></p>
<p><em>-Zach B, Roommate for Life</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started to second guess myself. Was this really what I wanted? Was I actually being insane? What if I went through with it and then decided I didn't want it? I'd have to deal with all the stress of having to find an apartment while starting a new job, and trying to sell the stupid van on top of all of it. Would I actually be alright without truly having a home? I was in full-fledged panic mode, and I'd been on the West Coast less than a day. Panicking is very not my style, or so I like to think, so I decided to do the rational thing, and make a list of pros and cons of living in a van, and then make a well-informed decision based on that. So, ordered from most important to least important reasons, here is my list:</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money Savings.</strong> Even sharing bedrooms, rent in the Bay area is going to cost at least $1,000 a month. That's a bare minimum, it doesn't include utilities or anything else. It's $12,000+ a year that I'm practically just burning. No return, no equity, just gone.</li>
<li><strong>Life Experience.</strong> I've never truly stepped outside my comfort zone. After living in California for a summer, I realized just how little of the world I've actually seen. If I do plan on travelling the world, I'll need to be comfortable with unconventional living situations, and this is certainly a good place to start. Plus, there is never going to be a better time in my life for me to try this. I'm young, flexible, and I don't have to worry about this decision affecting anyone else in my life.</li>
<li><strong>Transportation and Proximity.</strong> Having a car is very much a necessity, and by living in it on campus, I can cut my commute down to a few seconds instead of hours, which means I can spend my time more productively. Plus, I hate traffic, and my company's 25,000+ employees ensure that there is a whole lot of it in the morning and evening hours.</li>
<li><strong>Health Benefits.</strong> If I'm living in a van, I have no choice but to go to the gym on campus to shower, so living in a van provides me with a strict daily regimen. In a similar vein, since I'm eating all my meals at work, it means my diet will be organized into three meals a day during the week, without any late-night snacking.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Suicide.</strong> I will most certainly be "That Guy". No amount of planning or forethought excuses the fact that I'm the psychopath living in a van in the parking lot. People will eventually find out, and it <strong>will</strong> affect my social life.</li>
<li><strong>Inconvenience.</strong> Living in a car is not convenient. There's no bathroom, shower, or refrigerator in a reasonable distance.</li>
<li><strong>Stress and Anxiety.</strong> The whole process is supremely stressful. Picking out a van, buying it, converting my license, getting insurance, all without a car and all before I've even started working and making money is a lot to deal with. Not to mention the illegality of most of it. Then once all of those things are out of the way, I'm still pretty anxious about being caught, and how I'm going to sneak into and out of my van.</li>
<li><strong>Upfront Expenses.</strong> At least with renting an apartment, I'd be paying gradually, without too much upfront cost. But between buying the car, buying insurance, fixing the car, setting it up, and the taxes and fees on top of all those things, it's a pretty big financial burden for someone who hasn't even started working yet.</li>
<li><strong>Good luck getting laid.</strong> Interestingly enough, it was my mom who asked me about this one. I can only imagine that it's going to be next to impossible to get laid when I'm the van guy. Sure, I can get a hotel for the night, but it's still strange and I still have a bit of explaining and convincing to do. Since I'm not nearly smooth enough for that, I've accepted the fact that I'm going to be celibate for the next who knows how long.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>As you can guess by the fact that this blog even exists, I'm in the process of doing this, for real. I definitely wavered a bit before making my decision, I even posted in the "New Engineers" group looking for housing. But after weighing out the pros and cons, and evaluating where I want my life to be in 4-5 years, I decided that I'm going to do it.</p>
<h3>A Slight Detour</h3>
<p>One of the main things I realized from writing out the benefits and drawbacks was that it wasn't a van that I wanted. I wanted something more personal, something where I could relax even if I wasn't sleeping. And that's how I ended up with a 16' box truck, pictured above. After about ten hours of looking around at vehicles, at $8,800 (before taxes and fees), this 2006 Ford E350 Super Duty Cargo Van with 157,000 miles looked like the best bet. The "box" part is a roomy 128 ft<sup>2</sup>, larger than any of the bedrooms I've ever lived in prior.</p>
<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>The past few days have been a stream of car-related errands. I purchased the car on Wednesday, after a grueling five hours at <a href="http://www.greenlightmotors1.com/">Green Light Motors</a> doing test drives and looking over the truck and applying for financing and insurances. On Thursday, I got new tires and a license to match. On Friday, I picked up the bed. Along the way, I've also done a bit of graffiti and insect removal, all part of the package.</p>
<p>The hardest part so far has really been parking the damned thing. It's roughly 20 feet long and 11 feet high, which means that it doesn't fit in most parking spaces, and even when it does, overhanging trees threaten to rip the top off. In the large, open-air parking lots on campus, this won't be a big deal, but maneuvering it around in the meantime has certainly put my CDL knowledge to work.</p>

      <description>It took me a few days to code up this blog, so I'm going to write a couple of posts back to back just to catch the site up to speed with my life.</description>

<p>And here is where things start to get interesting. Since my internship last summer, when I realized the only thing I needed was a place to sleep, and company perks could provide the rest, I've done a little bit of <a href="http://www.quora.com/Which-Googler-holds-the-record-for-living-at-Google-HQ">research</a> into how exactly this whole van situation would play out. In my search, the most encouraging thing I found was this:
<blockquote>
<p>Google Security came by very early on, but once they determined that the guy in the mysteriously parked white van was just an eccentric Googler and not the Unabomber, they never came by again.</p>
<p><em>-Ben Discoe, Google [x] UI programmer</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If tech companies weren't actively preventing this, I might as well give it a shot. Worst case scenario, the whole thing doesn't work out and I get an overpriced apartment like a normal human being.</p>
<h2>Figuring it out</h2>
<p>Eventually, I started putting pen to paper and figuring out the logistics of the whole scenario. I would get either a <a href="http://www.ford.com/trucks/transitconnect/">Ford Transit Connect Van</a>, a <a href="http://www.conversionvanland.com/">Chevy Conversion Van</a>, or a <a href="http://www.mbsprinterusa.com/">Mercedes-Benz Sprinter</a>. All of them had enough space to put a bed in the back and keep a few basic belongings. For food, I would eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at work, Monday through Friday. On weekends, I would eat select meals at work, and explore the Bay area for my other meals. As far as hygiene goes, I'd work out every morning at one of the corporate gyms, and shower and do other morning stuff after. If I needed a bathroom during the day, naturally I would use one at work, and I would hang around campus working on work and personal projects until I was ready to go to sleep, and then I would retire to my van conveniently parked in a nearby campus parking lot. For official documents, I'd use a <a href="http://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/Pages/index.aspx">Private Mailbox</a>, because you can't put a PO Box address on many different types of documents. I felt like I had my bases pretty covered. Naturally, there are still going to be unanswered questions though, and I hear new ones every time I explain the idea to people.</p>
